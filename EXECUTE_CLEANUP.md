# Git History Cleanup - EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

## Ready to Execute
The git history cleanup script has been reviewed, updated, and validated. It's ready for execution within the next 24 hours.

## Pre-execution Checklist
- [x] Script updated with comprehensive patterns
- [x] Safety checks implemented  
- [x] Backup strategy documented
- [x] Java runtime verified (OpenJDK 17.0.16)
- [x] BFG Repo Cleaner download tested
- [x] Script validation confirmed

## Current Repository State
**Sensitive Content Detected:**
- 100+ files with family/privileged patterns in git history
- 12+ commits with sensitive terms in messages
- Complete family-dashboard application in history
- Authentication and deployment scripts

**Script Enhancements Made:**
- Comprehensive pattern matching for all sensitive content
- Enhanced safety checks and validations
- Multiple confirmation prompts
- Detailed verification before force push
- Automatic backup creation
- Team notification reminders

## EXECUTION STEPS (Within 24 Hours)

### 1. Prepare Repository
```bash
cd /Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai

# Commit or stash all changes first
git add .
git commit -m "Pre-cleanup commit: stage all current work"
git push origin main

# Verify clean state
git status
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 2. Execute Cleanup Script
```bash
# Run the interactive cleanup script
./clean-git-history.sh
```

**Expected Prompts:**
1. Pre-analysis confirmation
2. Main execution confirmation: type `yes-clean-history`
3. Force push confirmation: type `force-push`

### 3. Post-execution Verification
The script automatically:
- Creates backup at `$HOME/candlefish-history-backup-*`
- Verifies all sensitive content removed
- Tests repository integrity
- Provides team notification template

### 4. Team Coordination
**Send this message to Tyler and Aaron:**

> The candlefish-ai repository has been updated with security cleanup.
> Please delete your local copy and re-clone:
> 
> ```bash
> rm -rf candlefish-ai
> git clone https://github.com/candlefish-ai/candlefish-ai.git
> ```
> 
> All current functionality remains intact. This only affected git history.

### 5. Monitor Systems
- [ ] Verify Netlify deployments still work
- [ ] Check CI/CD pipelines 
- [ ] Confirm team members re-clone successfully
- [ ] Monitor for any issues over 24 hours

## Script Safety Features

### Automatic Validations
- Repository name validation (candlefish-ai only)
- Uncommitted changes detection
- Main branch requirement
- Remote connectivity check

### Interactive Confirmations
- Pre-analysis review with sample content
- Explicit confirmation prompts
- Option to abort at multiple points
- Verification before force push

### Backup Protection
- Automatic full repository backup
- Backup location provided for rollback
- Original history preserved locally

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive verification checks
- Fail-safe if verification fails  
- Option to force-continue or abort
- Detailed error reporting

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)
If critical issues occur after cleanup:

```bash
# Navigate to backup
cd $HOME/candlefish-history-backup-*

# Force push backup to restore original
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

## Success Indicators
After successful execution:
- [ ] No sensitive patterns in `git log --all --name-only`
- [ ] No sensitive terms in commit messages
- [ ] Repository functions normally
- [ ] Deployments work correctly
- [ ] Team members can re-clone successfully

## Emergency Contact
If issues arise during or after cleanup:
- **Primary**: Patrick Smith (executor)
- **Backup Plan**: Restore from automatic backup
- **Team Support**: Assist Tyler/Aaron with re-cloning

## FINAL NOTES

**This is the final step in the security isolation process.**

The script has been thoroughly tested and includes multiple safety measures. It will:
1. Remove ALL traces of family/privileged content from git history
2. Clean commit messages by replacing sensitive terms
3. Maintain all current functionality
4. Provide comprehensive backup for safety

**Execute within 24 hours to complete the security isolation.**

The repository will be completely clean of sensitive content while preserving all legitimate functionality and development history.
