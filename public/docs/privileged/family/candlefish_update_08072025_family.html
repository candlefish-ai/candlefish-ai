    <h1>Candlefish AI: Our Family's Journey</h1>

    <h2>What This Means for Our Family</h2>

    <p>Hey Tyler, Kendall, and Trevor!</p>

    <p>We've been working on something special that we want to share with you. This isn't just a business – it's our family's opportunity to build something meaningful together.</p>

    <h3>1. How We're Creating Opportunity</h3>

    <p>We've designed a system that rewards your hard work and creativity. Here's how it works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shadow Credits</strong>: Every contribution you make gets tracked and can turn into real ownership</li>
        <li><strong>Quarterly Reviews</strong>: We'll celebrate and recognize your work together</li>
        <li><strong>Transparent Rules</strong>: No hidden agendas – everyone knows how the system works</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Your Path to Ownership</h3>

    <p>We've created three types of "family shares":</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Legacy Units</strong>: Guaranteed share for each of you (Kendall, Tyler, Trevor)</li>
        <li><strong>Contribution Units</strong>: Earn more based on what you contribute</li>
        <li><strong>Voting Units</strong>: A seat at the table in making big decisions</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3. How Money Works</h3>

    <p>When we start generating revenue:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Everyone gets a fair market salary</li>
        <li>We'll set aside money for future opportunities</li>
        <li>Profits get shared based on your contributions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Our Promises to You</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>We'll be transparent about everything</li>
        <li>Your work matters, and we'll prove it</li>
        <li>This is about building something together</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We can't wait to discuss this with you and hear your thoughts!</p>

    <p>Love,<br>Mom and Dad</p>
