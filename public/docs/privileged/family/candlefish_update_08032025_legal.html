        <div class="date">August 3, 2025</div>
    </div>

    <p>TO: Mike McIntosh, General Counsel<br>
    FROM: Patrick Smith<br>
    RE: Proposed Family Business Structure - Legal Review</p>

    <div class="legal-notice">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This document outlines the proposed corporate structure for Candlefish AI, with particular attention to regulatory compliance requirements during the founders' employment at Morgan Stanley.
    </div>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>This memorandum proposes a corporate structure for Candlefish AI that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintains compliance with SEC Rule 204A-1<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> and FINRA Rule 3210<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></li>
        <li>Provides for orderly transition of ownership upon change in employment status</li>
        <li>Establishes clear governance and operational boundaries</li>
        <li>Protects family interests while maintaining business flexibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Status and Regulatory Context</h2>
    <p>Candlefish AI is currently pre-revenue with active business development efforts underway. Due to Karen Smith's and my continued employment at Morgan Stanley, we are subject to regulatory restrictions that require careful structuring of any outside business activities.</p>

    <p>Specifically, FINRA Rule 3210 requires prior written notice to the member firm before engaging in outside business activities, and SEC regulations impose restrictions on securities-related activities by associated persons of investment advisers. To maintain full compliance, I currently hold 100% ownership of Candlefish Holdings LLC.</p>

    <h2>Proposed Ownership Structure</h2>
    <p>The ownership structure is designed to transition based on employment status:</p>

    <h3>Phase 1: During Morgan Stanley Employment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Patrick Smith: 100% ownership of Candlefish Holdings LLC</li>
        <li>Structure: Single-member LLC for simplicity and compliance</li>
        <li>Rationale: Maintains clear compliance boundaries</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phase 2: Post-Employment Transition</h3>
    <p>Upon both Karen's and my departure from Morgan Stanley (timing hypothetical and not predetermined):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Karen and Patrick Smith: Equal majority control (combined 70-80%)</li>
        <li>Tyler, Kendall, and Trevor Smith: Remaining equity (20-30% divided equally)</li>
        <li>Implementation: Operating Agreement amendment triggered by employment status change</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Corporate Structure</h2>
    <h3>Parent Entity: Candlefish Holdings LLC</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Houses all intellectual property, trademarks, and core technology</li>
        <li>Delaware LLC for favorable business law framework</li>
        <li>Pass-through taxation via Schedule K-1 distributions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Subsidiary Entities</h3>
    <p>Each vertical market operates through a separate subsidiary LLC:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Candlefish Trophy LLC</li>
        <li>Candlefish Paint LLC</li>
        <li>Candlefish Brewery LLC</li>
        <li>Additional subsidiaries as markets develop</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This structure provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Legal liability isolation between business units</li>
        <li>Clear financial reporting and performance tracking</li>
        <li>Flexibility for unit-specific partnerships or exits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Governance Framework</h2>
    <h3>Management Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CEO/Managing Member: Day-to-day operational decisions</li>
        <li>Annual Family Board Meeting: Major strategic decisions</li>
        <li>Decisions requiring family approval:
            <ul>
                <li>Launch of new subsidiaries</li>
                <li>Sale of equity exceeding 20% in any entity</li>
                <li>Compensation structure modifications</li>
                <li>Full or partial exit transactions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Employment and Compensation</h2>
    <h3>Active Participation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tyler Smith: Initial employee with market-rate base salary plus performance incentives</li>
        <li>Other family members: May join as employees or consultants at market rates</li>
        <li>Compensation methodology: Third-party benchmarking to ensure arm's length terms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Passive Ownership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Profit distributions based on ownership percentages</li>
        <li>No employment requirement for ownership retention</li>
        <li>Anti-dilution provisions for family members</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Revenue flows to operational subsidiaries</li>
        <li>Management fee (15-20%) paid to parent company for shared services</li>
        <li>Annual profit distributions after reserve requirements</li>
        <li>No cross-subsidization between subsidiaries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risk Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Key person life insurance on Patrick Smith</li>
        <li>Buy-sell agreement funded by insurance proceeds</li>
        <li>Annual third-party CPA review</li>
        <li>Annual legal compliance review</li>
        <li>Quarterly board reporting requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exit Strategies</h2>
    <p>The structure accommodates multiple exit scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individual subsidiary sales with parent company royalty/carry</li>
        <li>Strategic minority investments (capped at 20% per subsidiary)</li>
        <li>Full portfolio acquisition</li>
        <li>Family buyout provisions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendations for Implementation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Obtain formal written approval from Morgan Stanley compliance for current structure</li>
        <li>Draft comprehensive Operating Agreement with phase-based ownership provisions</li>
        <li>Establish subsidiary formation templates for rapid market entry</li>
        <li>Implement governance calendar and reporting frameworks</li>
        <li>Consider establishing advisory board with independent directors</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="legal-notice">
        <strong>Legal Counsel Review Requested:</strong> Please review this proposed structure for compliance with applicable securities regulations, employment law considerations, and tax optimization opportunities. Particular attention should be paid to the transition mechanism and ongoing compliance requirements.
