    <p>Tyler, Kendall, and Trevor,</p>

    <p>I wanted to share some thoughts about Candlefish AI and how we're thinking about structuring it as a family business. This letter is meant to start a conversation—your thoughts and concerns matter.</p>

    <p>First, a reality check: Candlefish is still pre-revenue. We have promising conversations and plenty of expenses, but no sales yet. Everything in this letter assumes we execute and the business actually works; if it stalls, we revisit every assumption.</p>

    <p>Because Karen and I remain employees of Morgan Stanley, compliance rules require that I alone hold 100 percent of Candlefish until we both exit the firm. If and when our circumstances change, ownership converts so that Karen and I share equal majority control, with the remaining equity allocated among the three of you. That arrangement keeps strategic decisions inside the nuclear family and ensures each child has a concrete stake from the start.</p>

    <p>All intellectual property, trademarks, and the master codebase sit in Candlefish Holdings LLC, a single-member parent company. Housing everything vital in one entity keeps taxes simple, legal discovery narrow, and the product vision coherent.</p>

    <p>Each industry we tackle—trophy shops, paint contractors, craft breweries—operates in its own subsidiary business unit under the parent company. Revenue, costs, and any legal risk stay inside that unit, so trouble in one vertical never endangers another. When a business unit matures, we may let a strategic partner buy up to twenty percent of that unit, but only as a non-voting stake; the parent company never cedes control.</p>

    <p>Tyler will be the only family member on payroll from day one. He will earn a market-rate base salary funded by the business units he serves, plus a performance share tied to the profit those units generate. Kendall and Trevor may choose later to join full-time, consult on projects, or pursue independent careers. Whether they step in immediately or years from now, compensation for active work will be measured against the same yardstick used for Tyler—market rates plus performance upside—so no sibling is advantaged or penalized by timing or role. Passive profit interests allocated at the parent-company level remain intact regardless of who works where, ensuring that effort is rewarded while long-term ownership stays balanced among the five of us.</p>

    <p>Cash collected from customers lands in the relevant business unit, covers direct costs, and then a fixed percentage flows up to the parent company to fund shared expenses such as security audits and design upgrades. Net profits at the parent level are distributed annually through a single K-1. No unit may subsidize another; if a vertical cannot pull its own weight, we shut it down cleanly.</p>

    <p>Day-to-day product decisions stay with me for coherence. Once a year the five of us meet to approve or reject any major moves—launching a new business unit, adjusting compensation caps, or accepting an acquisition offer. Extended relatives and outside specialists can earn royalties tied to the work they deliver but do not participate in governance.</p>

    <p>Safeguards are designed to keep the enterprise human-centric. Quarterly narrative reports—plain English, no jargon—will explain what worked, what failed, and what comes next. Key-person insurance on me funds a buy-sell agreement, so the company never faces a forced fire sale if I become unavailable. One outside CPA and one attorney (working with Poppy) review every entity each year to spot trouble early.</p>

    <p>If a business unit compounds well, we can spin it out as its own company while Candlefish retains a royalty or preferred equity position; if a buyer wants the whole portfolio, we sell the parent and all units in one clean transaction. Either outcome preserves the integrity of family relationships while maximizing value.</p>

    <p>Please read this closely and bring any questions or concerns to me. I'd also like to discuss this together after Poppy has reviewed the legal structure. Remember, this is a starting point—we can adjust based on everyone's input. Fairness, clarity, and flexibility for all five of us are built in by design, but I welcome your thoughts before we lock it down.</p>

    <p>Love,<br>
    Pat</p>
