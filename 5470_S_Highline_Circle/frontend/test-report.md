**Assessment:** Backend service is running and responsive on Fly.dev.

### 3. Core API Endpoints
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Rooms Endpoint:** Successfully returned 40 rooms with complete metadata  
**Items Endpoint:** Successfully returned 300+ items with detailed inventory data  
**Assessment:** Data layer is fully functional with rich item and room information.

### 4. CORS Headers Verification
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Test:** OPTIONS preflight request from inventory.highline.work  
**Response Headers:**
```
access-control-allow-origin: https://inventory.highline.work
access-control-allow-methods: GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS
access-control-allow-credentials: true
access-control-allow-headers: Origin,Content-Type,Accept,Authorization,X-Requested-With
```
**Assessment:** CORS is properly configured for cross-origin requests.

### 5. Photo Upload Test
**Status:** ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE  
**Error:** HTTP 500 - `runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`  
**Test Method:** Upload 1x1 pixel PNG to valid item  
**Error Handling:** Correctly rejects invalid item IDs (400) and empty requests (400)  
**Assessment:** Upload endpoint has a critical runtime bug causing server crashes.

### 6. Frontend Build Verification
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Build Artifacts Present:**
- `dist/index.html` (1,354 bytes)
- `dist/assets/` directory with bundled resources
- `dist/manifest.json` (complete PWA manifest)
- `dist/sw.js` (service worker, 10,931 bytes)
- `dist/_redirects` (Netlify routing)

**Assessment:** Build is complete and production-ready.

### 7. PWA Configuration Analysis
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Manifest Features:**
- ✅ Standalone display mode
- ✅ Multiple icon sizes (72x72 to 512x512)
- ✅ Camera-specific shortcuts ("Take Photos", "Bulk Upload")
- ✅ Proper categorization ("productivity", "business", "utilities")
- ✅ Mobile-optimized orientation ("any")
- ✅ Screenshot definitions for app stores

**Assessment:** Comprehensive PWA setup optimized for photo capture workflows.

### 8. Data Completeness Validation
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Rooms Found:** 40 (expected ~21, found more comprehensive data)  
**Items Found:** 300+ with detailed metadata including:
- Categories (Furniture, Art/Decor, Plant, etc.)
- Pricing information
- Floor/room assignments
- Invoice references
- Image tracking (has_images, image_count)

**Assessment:** Data is more comprehensive than expected, indicating robust inventory system.

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Photo Upload Runtime Error (CRITICAL)
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Location:** `POST /api/v1/items/{id}/photos`  
**Error:** `runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference`  
**Impact:** Photo upload functionality completely broken  
**Root Cause:** Likely nil pointer access in Go backend photo handling code  

**Reproduction Steps:**
1. Create valid multipart form with image file
2. POST to `/api/v1/items/{valid-item-id}/photos`
3. Server returns HTTP 500 with runtime error

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Review Go photo upload handler for nil pointer dereferences
2. Add proper null checking for form data parsing
3. Implement error handling for file processing
4. Add request validation middleware

---

## Recommendations

### 1. IMMEDIATE: Fix Photo Upload Critical Bug
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Timeline:** Within 24 hours  
**Action:** Debug and fix the nil pointer dereference in the photo upload endpoint

### 2. HIGH: Add Photo Upload Integration Tests
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Timeline:** Within 1 week  
**Action:** 
- Implement automated tests for photo upload functionality
- Add tests for various file formats and sizes
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

### 3. MEDIUM: Enhance Error Handling and Monitoring
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Timeline:** Within 2 weeks  
**Action:**
- Implement structured error logging
- Add health check for photo upload functionality
- Set up monitoring alerts for 500 errors

### 4. LOW: Data Validation Improvements
**Priority:** LOW  
**Timeline:** Within 1 month  
**Action:**
- Validate room count expectations (found 40 vs expected 21)
- Add data consistency checks
- Implement automated data validation tests
