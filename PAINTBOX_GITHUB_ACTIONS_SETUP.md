# Paintbox GitHub Actions Setup - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Paintbox deployment pipeline has been fully configured with a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that handles testing, building, and deploying the application across multiple environments.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Workflow File
Created `paintbox-deploy-enhanced.yml` with:
- Database setup and migrations
- Temporal workflow testing
- Security scanning with Trivy
- Performance monitoring with Lighthouse
- Multi-environment deployment (Fly.io, Vercel, Netlify)
- Post-deployment integration tests
- Automated notifications and issue creation

### 2. Database Infrastructure
**File**: `projects/paintbox/scripts/init-database.ts`
- Automated database schema creation
- Tables for users, projects, estimates, photos, calculations cache
- Audit logging and session management
- Stored procedures for maintenance tasks

### 3. Health Check Endpoints
Created comprehensive health monitoring:
- `/api/health` - Main health check
- `/api/health/database` - Database connectivity
- `/api/health/cache` - Redis cache status
- `/api/v1/agent/health` - Agent platform integration
- `/api/v1/salesforce/health` - Salesforce integration
- `/api/v1/companycam/health` - CompanyCam integration

### 4. CORS Middleware
**File**: `projects/paintbox/lib/middleware/cors.ts`
- Environment-based configuration (strict for production)
- Support for multiple origins
- Preflight request handling
- Credentials support

### 5. Agent Platform Integration
- Configured Temporal workflow testing in CI
- Agent API route with proper authentication
- Health checks for agent platform connectivity

## Workflow Features

### Testing Matrix
- **Linting** - Code style and quality checks
- **TypeScript** - Type checking with strict mode
- **Unit Tests** - Component and function testing
- **Excel Parity** - Formula calculation validation
- **Integration Tests** - API and service testing
- **Security Tests** - Vulnerability scanning

### Build Optimization
- Docker image building with health checks
- Bundle size analysis
- Build artifact caching
- Multi-stage builds for efficiency

### Deployment Strategies
- **Staging** - Automatic deployment to Fly.io
- **Preview** - Pull request deployments to Vercel
- **Production** - Manual or automated promotion
- **Rollback** - Support for quick rollbacks

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Lighthouse performance scores
- Health check validations
- Deployment notifications
- Automatic issue creation on failures

## Environment Variables Required

Add these secrets to GitHub repository settings:

```yaml
# Deployment Platforms
FLY_API_TOKEN
VERCEL_TOKEN
VERCEL_ORG_ID
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID_PAINTBOX
NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN
NETLIFY_SITE_ID_PAINTBOX

# Database
DATABASE_URL
TEST_DATABASE_URL

# Cache
REDIS_URL
TEST_REDIS_URL

# Integrations
AGENT_PLATFORM_URL
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET
COMPANYCAM_API_KEY

# Monitoring
SENTRY_DSN

# Testing
STAGING_API_KEY
```

## Usage

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Trigger deployment via GitHub UI
# Actions → Deploy Paintbox Application → Run workflow

# Select options:
- Environment: staging/production
- Deployment type: standard/blue-green/canary
- Skip tests: false (only in emergencies)
```

### Automatic Deployment
- **Push to main**: Deploys to staging
- **Pull Request**: Creates preview deployment
- **Merge to main + Manual approval**: Production deployment

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd projects/paintbox
npm install

# Run database migrations
npx ts-node scripts/init-database.ts

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:excel-parity
npm run test:integration

# Build application
npm run build:deploy

# Test Docker build
docker build -f Dockerfile.fly.simple .
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check application health
curl https://paintbox-app.fly.dev/api/health

# Check specific services
curl https://paintbox-app.fly.dev/api/health/database
curl https://paintbox-app.fly.dev/api/health/cache
curl https://paintbox-app.fly.dev/api/v1/agent/health
```

### Performance Metrics
- Lighthouse scores available in workflow artifacts
- Bundle size tracked in build outputs
- Response time metrics in health endpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **TypeScript Errors**
   - Check `tsconfig.json` settings
   - Ensure all dependencies have type definitions
   - Run `npm run typecheck` locally

2. **Database Connection**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure migrations have run

3. **Build Failures**
   - Clear `.next` directory
   - Check Node.js version (should be 18)
   - Verify environment variables

4. **Deployment Issues**
   - Check platform-specific secrets
   - Verify Docker image builds locally
   - Review deployment logs in GitHub Actions

## Next Steps

1. **Set up production database**
   - Create production PostgreSQL instance
   - Configure backup strategy
   - Set up read replicas if needed

2. **Configure monitoring**
   - Set up Sentry project
   - Configure application performance monitoring
   - Create custom dashboards

3. **Enable auto-scaling**
   - Configure Fly.io auto-scaling rules
   - Set up load balancing
   - Configure CDN for static assets

4. **Security hardening**
   - Enable Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Configure rate limiting
   - Set up DDoS protection
