### Coverage Thresholds

The test suite enforces minimum coverage thresholds:

- **Global Minimum**: 80% (statements, branches, functions, lines)
- **Frontend Minimum**: 85% (higher bar for UI components)
- **Per-File Minimum**: Enabled to ensure consistent quality

## 🎯 Test Data Management

### Test Data Factories

The test suite uses comprehensive data factories for consistent test data:

```typescript
// Generate test room
const room = createTestRoom({
  name: 'Living Room',
  roomType: 'living'
});

// Generate test item with relations
const item = createTestItem({
  name: 'Samsung TV',
  roomId: room.id,
  withImages: true,
  withActivities: true
});

// Generate test user with permissions
const user = createTestUser({
  role: 'admin',
  permissions: ['inventory:read', 'inventory:write']
});
```

### Database Seeding

- Automated test database setup with Docker
- Consistent seed data across test runs
- Isolated test environments
- Transaction-based test cleanup

## 🔧 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The test suite includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline:

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Setup** - Environment and dependency installation
2. **Lint & Type Check** - Code quality validation
3. **Unit Tests** - Component-level testing
4. **Integration Tests** - Service integration validation
5. **E2E Tests** - Full workflow testing
6. **Performance Tests** - Load testing validation
7. **Coverage Report** - Coverage analysis and reporting
8. **Security Scan** - Dependency vulnerability checks

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- No high-severity security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained

### Coverage Integration

- **Codecov Integration** - Automatic coverage reporting
- **PR Coverage Reports** - Coverage diff on pull requests
- **Coverage Badges** - Visual coverage indicators
- **Threshold Enforcement** - Build failure on coverage drops

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create Test File**
   ```bash
   # Follow naming convention: *.test.{ts,tsx} or *.spec.{ts,tsx}
   touch __tests__/backend/inventory/new-feature.test.ts
   ```

2. **Use Test Factories**
   ```typescript
   import { createTestItem } from '../../utils/test-data-factories';
   
   describe('New Feature', () => {
     it('should handle test scenario', async () => {
       const testItem = createTestItem();
       // Test implementation
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Run Tests During Development**
   ```bash
   # Watch mode for active development
   pnpm test:watch
   
   # Run specific test file
   pnpm test __tests__/backend/inventory/new-feature.test.ts
   ```

### Debugging Tests

```bash
# Run tests in debug mode
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand

# Debug E2E tests with UI
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Debug performance tests with verbose output
k6 run --verbose __tests__/performance/k6-inventory-load-tests.js
```

### Test Best Practices

1. **Follow AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
2. **Use Descriptive Names** - Clear test intent
3. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation** - Focus on outcomes
4. **Maintain Test Independence** - No test interdependencies
5. **Mock External Dependencies** - Isolate units under test
6. **Clean Up After Tests** - Prevent test pollution

## 📈 Monitoring & Reporting

### Test Metrics

The test suite tracks and reports:

- **Test Execution Time** - Performance monitoring
