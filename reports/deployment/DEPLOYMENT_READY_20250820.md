### Pre-Deployment Validation Summary

#### 1. Test Suite Status
- **Unit Tests**: Configuration issues detected (Jest config needs update)
- **Security Tests**: Configuration issues (testPathPattern deprecated)

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH PRIORITY**:

2. Missing health monitoring scripts should be created

**MEDIUM PRIORITY**:
1. Create missing security rotation scripts
2. Implement comprehensive health checks

### Deployment Decision

⚠️ **PROCEED WITH CAUTION**: While core deployment infrastructure is ready, test suite issues should be resolved before production deployment.

### Next Steps
1. Fix Jest configuration issues
2. Create missing monitoring scripts
3. Proceed to staging deployment for validation
4. Monitor staging environment for 30+ minutes
5. If stable, proceed to production with blue-green deployment
