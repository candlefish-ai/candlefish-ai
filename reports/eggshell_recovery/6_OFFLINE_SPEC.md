**Version**: 1.0

## Executive Summary

This document provides a **completely honest assessment** of Paintbox's offline capabilities. Based on thorough analysis of the codebase, we document what **actually works offline** versus what requires internet connectivity, ensuring truthful marketing and setting proper user expectations.

## Current Offline Implementation Status

### ✅ What Actually Works Offline

#### 1. **Draft Estimate Storage** (Working)
- **Technology**: IndexedDB via Dexie 4.0.11
- **Storage**: `/lib/db/offline-db.ts` - Comprehensive IndexedDB schema
- **Capability**: Save estimate drafts locally with full data persistence
- **Evidence**: Complete database schema with estimates, photos, calculations cache

```typescript
// Proven offline capability
await offlineDB.saveEstimate(estimateId, data);
await offlineDB.savePhoto(photoId, blob, metadata);
```

#### 2. **Painting Calculations** (Working) 
- **Technology**: Decimal.js for client-side calculation engine
- **Capability**: Full calculation engine works without internet
- **Evidence**: `/lib/calculations/offline-calculator.ts` (701 lines of calculation logic)
- **Coverage**: Area calculations, material costs, labor estimates, Good/Better/Best options

#### 3. **Service Worker Caching** (Working)
- **Technology**: Custom service worker at `/public/sw.js`
- **Capability**: Caches critical app resources for offline navigation
- **Evidence**: Precaches 16 critical URLs, implements cache-first strategies
- **Limitations**: Only caches static assets and core pages

#### 4. **Photo Storage** (Working)
- **Technology**: IndexedDB blob storage
- **Capability**: Store photos as Blobs locally with metadata
- **Evidence**: Complete photo management in offline database schema

#### 5. **Network Status Detection** (Working)
- **Technology**: Navigator.onLine + custom indicators
- **Capability**: Visual offline indicators throughout UI
- **Evidence**: `/components/ui/OfflineIndicator.tsx` with comprehensive status display

### ❌ What Does NOT Work Offline

#### 1. **Salesforce Integration** (Online Only)
- **Reality**: No offline Salesforce data, requires live API connection
- **Impact**: Customer data, project sync requires internet
- **API Endpoints**: `/app/api/v1/salesforce/*` - all require network

#### 2. **Company Cam Photo Sync** (Online Only)
- **Reality**: Photos stored locally but upload requires internet
- **Impact**: Photo sharing/sync fails without connection

#### 3. **Customer Search** (Online Only)
- **Reality**: No local customer database
- **Impact**: Cannot search existing customers offline

#### 4. **Real-time Collaboration** (Online Only)
- **Reality**: WebSocket features require live connection
- **Impact**: Multi-user features unavailable offline

#### 5. **PDF Generation Server** (Online Only)
- **Reality**: PDF generation requires server-side processing
- **Impact**: Cannot generate final estimate PDFs offline

## Offline Architecture Analysis

### Database Layer (Sophisticated)
```typescript
// IndexedDB Tables (All Working)
- estimates: Draft estimates with sync status
- photos: Blob storage with metadata
- calculations: Cached calculation results
- customers: Customer data cache (limited)
- syncQueue: Background sync management
- settings: App configuration
```

### Sync Strategy (Partially Implemented)
- **Queue-based sync**: Implemented in `/stores/useOfflineStore.ts`
- **Background sync**: Service worker handlers exist but need completion
- **Conflict resolution**: UI hooks exist but limited implementation

### Service Worker Strategy
```javascript
// Cache Strategies Implemented:
- Static assets: Cache-first (30 days)
- API calls: Network-first with cache fallback (5 minutes)
- HTML pages: Network-first with offline page fallback
- Media files: Cache-first (7 days)
```
