**Result Types**:
- 📸 Full-page screenshots at each test step
- 📄 JSON result files with detailed findings
- 📊 Calculation and data verification logs
- 🔍 Error context and debugging information

### 🎨 Adaptive Testing Strategy

The test suite employs an **adaptive detection strategy** to handle the evolving nature of the application:

1. **Multiple Selector Strategies**: Each test tries multiple CSS selectors and element identification methods
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Tests continue even if specific UI elements aren't found
3. **Evidence-Based Validation**: Success is measured by finding evidence of functionality rather than exact UI matches
4. **Comprehensive Screenshots**: Visual evidence captured at each step for manual verification

## Execution Instructions

### 🚀 Running Individual Golden Path Tests

```bash
# Run specific Golden Path
npx playwright test __tests__/e2e/golden-paths/gp1-create-estimate-client-save.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test __tests__/e2e/golden-paths/gp2-exterior-surfaces-totals.spec.ts --project=chromium

# Run with debugging
npx playwright test __tests__/e2e/golden-paths/gp3-interior-rooms-totals.spec.ts --debug
```

### 🎯 Running Complete Golden Paths Suite

```bash
# Run all Golden Path tests

## Initial Test Execution Results

### 🧪 First Test Run - GP1 Against Production

**Executed**: 2025-08-22 00:35 UTC  
**Target**: https://paintbox.fly.dev  
**Browser**: Chromium  
**Status**: ❌ **IDENTIFIED WORKFLOW ISSUES**

**Key Findings**:
1. ✅ **Navigation Successful**: Test successfully navigated to `/estimate/new`
2. ❌ **Redirect Issue**: Page loads but gets stuck in loading state, never redirects to `/estimate/new/details`
3. ✅ **Loading UI Detected**: Found "Creating New Estimate" loading screen with proper messaging
4. ❌ **Workflow Blocked**: Cannot proceed past initial loading screen

**Page State Captured**:
```yaml
- heading "Creating New Estimate"
- paragraph: "Setting up your professional estimate workspace..."
- status "Loading": Loading...
- text: "Client Details Ready to Start"
```

**Artifacts Generated**:
- 📸 Screenshots: `test-results/golden-paths-gp1-create-es-*/test-failed-1.png`
- 🎬 Video: `test-results/golden-paths-gp1-create-es-*/video.webm`
- 📄 Error Context: `test-results/golden-paths-gp1-create-es-*/error-context.md`

### 🔍 What This Tells Us

**Good News**:
- ✅ Test infrastructure is working perfectly
- ✅ Application is accessible and responsive
- ✅ UI components are rendering correctly
- ✅ Tests capture detailed evidence of actual state

**Issues Identified**:
- ❌ GP1 workflow is incomplete - loading never finishes
- ❌ Redirect from `/estimate/new` to `/estimate/new/details` is broken
- ❌ Client form is not accessible due to loading state

**This is exactly what we wanted** - truthful reporting of what actually works vs. what needs implementation.

## Expected Outcomes

### ✅ Success Criteria

Each Golden Path test is considered **successful** if:

1. **GP1**: Can navigate to estimate creation, fill client fields, and detect save functionality
2. **GP2**: Can add surface data, input dimensions, and capture calculation results
3. **GP3**: Can add room data, input dimensions, and verify area calculations  
4. **GP4**: Can detect photo upload capabilities and CompanyCam integration
5. **GP5**: Can access review workflow and detect export functionality
6. **GP6**: Can identify Salesforce integration points and API availability
7. **GP7**: Can simulate offline mode and detect queue/sync capabilities
8. **GP8**: Can locate telemetry information and system status data

### 📊 Result Analysis

**Test Results Include**:
- ✅ **Functionality Detection**: Whether each Golden Path's core functionality is accessible
- 📈 **Data Validation**: Verification of calculations, persistence, and integrity
- 🔄 **Workflow Continuity**: Ability to progress through multi-step processes
- 🛡️ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing features or broken components
- 📸 **Visual Evidence**: Screenshots documenting actual application state

### 🔍 Truthful Reporting

**The test suite is designed to be truthful about what actually works vs. what needs implementation:**

- Tests will **PASS** if they can access and interact with functionality (even if incomplete)
- Tests will **DOCUMENT** missing features without failing the overall suite
- Results will **CLEARLY INDICATE** which features are fully functional vs. partially implemented
- Screenshots provide **VISUAL PROOF** of actual application state

## Next Steps

### 🏃‍♂️ Immediate Actions (Based on GP1 Test Results)

1. **Fix GP1 Loading Redirect Issue**: 
   ```bash
   # The loading screen in /estimate/new/page.tsx needs investigation
   # Router.replace('/estimate/new/details') is not working
   ```

2. **Test Additional Golden Paths**: Run remaining tests to identify working vs. broken workflows
   ```bash
   # Test each Golden Path individually
   npx playwright test __tests__/e2e/golden-paths/gp2-exterior-surfaces-totals.spec.ts
   npx playwright test __tests__/e2e/golden-paths/gp3-interior-rooms-totals.spec.ts
   # ... etc
   ```

3. **Review Results**: Analyze artifacts in `/reports/eggshell_recovery/artifacts/`

4. **Prioritize Fixes**: Based on initial findings:
   - **URGENT**: Fix GP1 loading redirect mechanism
   - **HIGH**: Test GP2/GP3 workflow accessibility  
   - **MEDIUM**: Validate remaining integration points

### 🎯 Focus Areas (Based on Test Preparation)

**Priority 1 - Core Workflow (GP1-GP3)**:
- Ensure estimate creation workflow is functional
- Verify calculation engines for exterior/interior
- Test data persistence and form handling

**Priority 2 - Integration Features (GP4-GP6)**:
- CompanyCam photo integration
- PDF/JSON export functionality  
- Salesforce sync capabilities

**Priority 3 - Advanced Features (GP7-GP8)**:
- Offline functionality and data sync
- Telemetry and monitoring systems

### 🔧 Test Suite Maintenance

- **Regular Execution**: Run Golden Paths tests before each deployment
- **Selector Updates**: Update element selectors as UI evolves
- **New Scenarios**: Add edge cases and additional test scenarios
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution times and failure patterns
