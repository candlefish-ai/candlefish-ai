# Staging Deployment Status Report
**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Time:** 02:07 UTC  
**Branch:** main (merged from owner/fix-p0-20250119)  
**Environment:** Fly.io Staging (paintbox.fly.dev)

## Executive Summary

## Deployment Details

### Infrastructure
- **Platform:** Fly.io
- **App Name:** paintbox
- **URL:** https://paintbox.fly.dev
- **Version:** 40
- **Machines:** 2 (both healthy)
- **Region:** sjc (San Jose)
- **Machine IDs:**
  - 1859edea1d6218 (app, started, 2/2 checks passing)
  - e829531b0127e8 (app, started, 2/2 checks passing)

### Configuration Applied
- ✅ Environment variables configured via AWS Secrets Manager
- ✅ Salesforce credentials updated
- ✅ CompanyCam credentials configured
- ✅ JWT secrets deployed
- ✅ Monitoring enabled
- ✅ Rate limiting activated

## Current Status

### Health Check Results
```json
{
  "status": "warning",
  "environment": "staging",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "uptime": 156 seconds,
  "requestCount": 15,
  "checks": {
    "memory": "warning (226MB/239MB used)",
    "uptime": "healthy",
    "jwks": "warning (0 keys, 14 errors)",
    "next": "healthy",
    "disk": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### API Endpoint Status
| Endpoint | Status | Response Time | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------|
| /api/health | ✅ 200 | 108ms | Healthy |
| /api/.well-known/jwks.json | ❌ 404 | 1050ms | JWKS endpoint needs configuration |
| /api/metrics | ❌ 404 | 206ms | Metrics endpoint needs setup |
| /api/v1/salesforce/test | ⚠️ 503 | 6741ms | Service unavailable - needs credential verification |
| /api/v1/companycam/test | ❌ 404 | 15217ms | Endpoint not found - needs implementation |

## Issues Identified

### High Priority
1. **JWKS Endpoint Missing** - The JWT public key endpoint returns 404
2. **Salesforce Integration Error** - 503 Service Unavailable (likely credential issue)
3. **CompanyCam Endpoint Missing** - Test endpoint not implemented

### Medium Priority
1. **Metrics Endpoint Missing** - /api/metrics returns 404
2. **Memory Warning** - Using 226MB of 239MB (94.5% utilization)
3. **Slow Response Times** - Several endpoints exceeding 500ms threshold

### Low Priority
1. **JWKS Errors** - 14 errors logged, 0 keys available
2. **Missing Metrics Token** - Fly.io metrics token unavailable

## Monitoring Setup

### Continuous Monitoring Active
- **Duration:** 48 hours (ends January 21, 2025)
- **Check Interval:** Every 5 minutes
- **Process ID:** 22211
- **Log File:** `/Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/reports/staging-monitor-20250820-020737.log`

### Monitoring Metrics
- Health endpoint status
- API endpoint availability
- Response times
- Memory usage
- Error rates
- Fly.io machine status

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next 4 Hours)
1. [ ] Fix JWKS endpoint configuration
2. [ ] Verify Salesforce credentials are correct
3. [ ] Implement CompanyCam test endpoint
4. [ ] Setup metrics endpoint

### Within 24 Hours
1. [ ] Monitor memory usage trends
2. [ ] Review error logs for patterns
3. [ ] Optimize slow endpoints
4. [ ] Test all user workflows

### Before Production (48 Hours)
1. [ ] Ensure all integrations are functional
2. [ ] Verify error rate < 1%
3. [ ] Confirm memory usage stable < 2GB
4. [ ] Complete load testing
5. [ ] Get stakeholder approval

## Success Criteria for Production

The following must be met before production deployment:

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Uptime | > 99.9% | 100% | ✅ Met |
| Error Rate | < 1% | ~5% | ❌ Not Met |
| Response Time (p95) | < 500ms | ~1000ms | ❌ Not Met |
| Memory Usage | < 2GB | 226MB | ✅ Met |
| All Integrations | Working | 0/2 | ❌ Not Met |
| Security Headers | Present | Unknown | ⚠️ Needs Verification |
| JWKS Endpoint | Available | Missing | ❌ Not Met |

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks
- **High:** Salesforce integration not working - critical for business operations
- **High:** JWKS endpoint missing - authentication may fail
- **Medium:** Memory at 94.5% utilization - potential for OOM errors
- **Low:** Slow response times - may impact user experience

### Mitigation Plan
1. Fix integration issues before any production traffic
2. Implement proper JWKS endpoint immediately
3. Monitor memory closely, scale if needed
4. Optimize endpoints after core functionality verified

## Commands Reference

### Monitor Status
```bash
# View live logs
tail -f /Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/reports/staging-monitor-20250820-020737.log

# Check monitor process
ps -p 22211

# Stop monitoring (if needed)
kill 22211
```

### Manual Checks
```bash
# Run single check
/Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/paintbox/scripts/monitor-staging.sh once

# Check Fly.io status
fly status --app paintbox

# View recent logs
fly logs --app paintbox -n 50
```

### Deploy Updates
```bash
# Deploy fixes
fly deploy --app paintbox

# Rollback if needed
fly releases rollback --app paintbox
```

## Conclusion

The staging deployment is functional but requires immediate attention to fix integration issues before production deployment. The 48-hour monitoring period will provide valuable stability data, but the identified issues must be resolved within the first 24 hours to meet the production deployment timeline.

**Deployment Status:** ⚠️ **STAGING - REQUIRES FIXES**
