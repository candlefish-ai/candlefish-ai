### Phase 3: Deployment ✅
- Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub main branch
- Resolved 101MB file blocking push (performance-results.json)
- Deployed to Fly.io staging environment
- Configured staging secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- Started 48-hour continuous monitoring

## Current Status

### Staging Environment
- **URL:** https://paintbox.fly.dev
- **Status:** Running (2 healthy machines)
- **Region:** San Jose (sjc)
- **Monitoring:** Active for next 48 hours (PID: 22211)

### Known Issues Requiring Attention

#### High Priority (Fix within 4 hours)
1. **JWKS endpoint returning 404** - JWT authentication may fail
2. **Salesforce integration error (503)** - Critical for business operations
3. **CompanyCam endpoint missing** - Photo management unavailable

#### Medium Priority (Fix within 24 hours)
1. **Metrics endpoint missing** - Monitoring incomplete
2. **Memory at 94.5% utilization** - Risk of OOM errors
3. **Slow API response times** - Multiple endpoints > 500ms
