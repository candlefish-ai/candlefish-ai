## 🎯 Executive Summary

### The Situation
- **7 projects** in portfolio
- **AWS costs**: ~$35/month (very lean)
- **Critical security issues** in PromoterOS
- **Technical debt** in Paintbox (memory, database)

### The Decision
**Priority Focus** (per your direction):
1. **Paintbox** - Primary focus, most mature
2. **Crown Trophy** - B2B franchise opportunity
3. **PromoterOS** - Fix auth, then deploy
4. **Candlefish Business Solutions** - Keep active as infrastructure

**Archive**: Excel, Jonathon, Fogg directories

### The Plan
- **Week 1**: Fix critical security, deploy PromoterOS, migrate Paintbox DB
- **Week 2**: Onboard customers, generate first revenue
- **Success Metric**: $500 MRR by September 1, 2025
