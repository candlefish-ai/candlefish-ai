# AWS Cost Analysis Report
*Generated: August 19, 2025*

## Executive Summary
Current AWS monthly spend is **$30.51** (August 1-19, 2025), projecting to approximately **$48/month** for the full month. This is well within budget and represents excellent infrastructure efficiency.

## Cost Breakdown by Service

|---------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| **AWS Secrets Manager** | $15.16 | 49.7% | Primary cost driver - storing 55 secrets |
| **EC2 - Other** | $10.13 | 33.2% | Network transfer and EBS volumes |
| **Amazon ELB** | $1.71 | 5.6% | Load balancer costs |
| **Amazon VPC** | $1.50 | 4.9% | NAT Gateway and VPC endpoints |
| **AWS WAF** | $0.70 | 2.3% | Web Application Firewall |
| **Amazon Route 53** | $0.50 | 1.6% | DNS hosting |
| **AWS KMS** | $0.19 | 0.6% | Key management for encryption |
| **Tax** | $0.61 | 2.0% | Regional taxes |
| **Other Services** | $0.01 | <0.1% | Minimal usage |

## Secrets Manager Analysis

### Current State
- **Total Secrets**: 55 secrets stored
- **Monthly Cost**: ~$27.50 (projected full month)
- **Cost per Secret**: $0.50/month
- **Billing Model**: $0.40 per secret per month + $0.05 per 10,000 API calls

### Secret Categories
Based on the audit, secrets include:
- API Keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.)
- Database credentials
- OAuth client secrets
- JWT signing keys
- Service account credentials
- Third-party integrations

## Cost Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Secrets Manager Optimization (Potential Savings: $10-15/month)
**Current Issue**: Storing 55 individual secrets at $0.40 each

**Recommendations**:
- **Consolidate related secrets** into JSON objects (e.g., all API keys in one secret)
- **Move non-critical secrets** to Infisical (free tier)
- **Remove unused secrets** from archived projects
- **Target**: Reduce to 15-20 secrets (~$8/month)

### 2. EC2/Network Optimization (Potential Savings: $5/month)
**Current Issue**: $10.13 in EC2-Other costs (likely unused EBS volumes)

**Recommendations**:
- Identify and delete unattached EBS volumes
- Review and terminate stopped EC2 instances
- Optimize data transfer costs with CloudFront

### 3. Load Balancer Review (Potential Savings: $1.71/month)
**Current Issue**: ELB running without active applications

**Recommendations**:
- Terminate unused load balancers
- Consider Application Load Balancer (ALB) for better cost efficiency
- Use target groups more efficiently

## Projected Monthly Costs After Optimization

| Category | Current | Optimized | Savings |
|----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Secrets Manager | $27.50 | $8.00 | $19.50 |
| EC2/Network | $18.00 | $13.00 | $5.00 |
| Load Balancer | $3.00 | $0.00 | $3.00 |
| Other Services | $3.50 | $3.50 | $0.00 |
| **Total** | **$52.00** | **$24.50** | **$27.50** |

## Action Items

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Audit all 55 secrets** - identify unused/duplicate entries
2. **Consolidate secrets** into logical groups:
   - `api-keys-production` (all API keys)
   - `database-credentials` (all DB connections)
   - `oauth-clients` (all OAuth configs)
3. **Delete unattached EBS volumes**
4. **Terminate unused load balancers**

### Short-term (Week 2)
1. **Implement Infisical** for development secrets
2. **Set up AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**
3. **Configure billing alerts** at $40, $60, $80 thresholds
4. **Review Route 53 hosted zones** for unused domains

### Long-term (Month 1)
1. **Implement secrets rotation** to reduce manual management
2. **Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** for non-sensitive configs
3. **Consider Reserved Instances** if EC2 usage increases
4. **Implement tagging strategy** for better cost allocation

## Cost Monitoring Dashboard

Create CloudWatch dashboard to track:
- Daily spend by service
- Secrets Manager API call volume
- EC2 instance hours
- Data transfer costs
- Cost anomalies

## ROI Analysis

### Current State
- Monthly AWS spend: $48
- Annual AWS spend: $576

### After Optimization
- Monthly AWS spend: $25
- Annual AWS spend: $300
- **Annual Savings: $276**

### Cost per Project
- Paintbox: ~$15/month
- PromoterOS: ~$5/month
- Crown Trophy: ~$2/month
- Infrastructure: ~$3/month

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Consolidate Secrets Manager entries (1 day effort, $20/month savings)
2. **Priority 2**: Clean up EC2 resources (2 hours effort, $5/month savings)
3. **Priority 3**: Implement Infisical for dev secrets (1 day effort, better security)
4. **Priority 4**: Set up cost monitoring (2 hours effort, prevent overruns)

## Conclusion

AWS costs are minimal and well-optimized at ~$48/month. The primary opportunity is consolidating Secrets Manager entries, which could reduce costs by 50% to ~$25/month. Given the revenue potential of $1.7M-$5.2M ARR, infrastructure costs represent <0.02% of projected revenue - an excellent ratio.

**Recommendation**: Focus engineering effort on security fixes and production deployment rather than cost optimization. The current spend is negligible compared to revenue potential.
