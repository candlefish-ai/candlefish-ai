# PromoterOS - Next Shippable Increment (NSI)

## Who It's For
**Primary Persona**: Independent concert promoters and venue owners
- Managing 1,200-3,500 capacity venues
- Booking 20-50 shows per year
- Need data-driven artist selection
- Struggling with TikTok/social media analytics

**Secondary Persona**: Artist booking agents
- Representing emerging artists
- Need venue matching
- Track social media momentum
- Route planning optimization

## What Changes in 30 Days

**For Promoters**:
- Artist discovery time reduced from days to minutes
- TikTok viral prediction before mainstream awareness
- Automated venue availability matching
- Data-backed booking decisions vs gut feel

**Measurable Outcomes**:
- 10x faster artist research
- 30% increase in show attendance via better matching
- 50% reduction in booking coordination time
- 2-week earlier detection of viral artists

## What It Won't Do (Scope Boundaries)
- No ticketing/sales integration
- No payment processing
- No contract management
- No venue operations (staff, inventory)
- No artist management features
- No livestreaming capabilities

## Acceptance Test

### Demo Script:
1. Promoter logs into PromoterOS
2. System shows trending artists in their genre/region
3. Promoter selects promising artist
4. Views TikTok metrics, growth trajectory, similar artists
5. Checks venue availability calendar
6. Sends booking inquiry with one click
7. Receives artist rider and requirements
8. Confirms preliminary booking
9. System tracks communication history
10. Analytics dashboard shows booking ROI

### Observable Outcome:
- 3 artist bookings initiated within first week
- Venue calendar populated for next quarter
- TikTok analytics integrated for 100+ artists
- Automated booking inquiries sent

## Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies:
- TikTok API access (public metrics)
- Spotify API for artist data
- Google Maps API for routing
- SendGrid for email automation

### External Dependencies:
- Venue provides calendar access
- Artists opt-in to platform
- Social media APIs remain available

### Risks:
1. **Authentication Bypass**: Critical security vulnerability
   - Mitigation: Fix within 24 hours
2. **API Rate Limits**: TikTok/Spotify restrictions
   - Mitigation: Implement caching layer
3. **Data Accuracy**: Social metrics can be gamed
   - Mitigation: Multi-source verification
4. **Market Timing**: Venues still recovering
   - Mitigation: Start with eager early adopters

## Effort Estimate

### Size: **SMALL** (1 week / 40 hours)

### Breakdown:
- Security fixes: 8 hours (Critical)
- Authentication enforcement: 4 hours (Critical)
- CORS configuration: 2 hours (Critical)
- Rate limiting (Redis): 4 hours
- API integration testing: 4 hours
- Deployment setup: 4 hours
- Customer onboarding: 8 hours
- Documentation: 4 hours
- Buffer: 2 hours

### Team Allocation:
- Patrick: Security fixes, API integrations
- Tyler: UI polish, deployment

## MVP Feature Set

### Must Have (Day 1-3):
- Secure authentication (fixed)
- Artist search/browse
- TikTok metrics display
- Basic venue calendar
- Contact/inquiry system

### Should Have (Day 4-5):
- Spotify integration
- Growth trajectory charts
- Email notifications
- Booking history

### Nice to Have (Week 2):
- Route optimization
- Similar artist recommendations
- ROI analytics
- Multi-venue support

## Success Metrics

### Technical:
- API response time < 500ms
- 99% uptime
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Successfully process 100 searches/day

### Business:
- 3 venues sign up in first week
- 10 booking inquiries sent
- 1 confirmed show booked via platform
- User session length > 10 minutes

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### GO if:
- Authentication vulnerability fixed
- CORS properly configured
- One venue commits to pilot
- TikTok API integration working

### NO-GO if:
- Security issues remain
- API rate limits blocking functionality
- No venue interest
- Core features unstable

## Implementation Priority

1. **Hour 1-4**: Fix authentication bypass
2. **Hour 5-8**: Configure CORS properly
3. **Day 2**: Implement Redis rate limiting
4. **Day 2**: Test all API integrations
5. **Day 3**: Deploy to production
6. **Day 3**: Onboard first venue
7. **Day 4-5**: Monitor and iterate

## Risk Mitigation

- **Plan B**: If TikTok API fails, use web scraping temporarily
- **Plan C**: Manual CSV import for artist data
- **Rollback**: Keep staging environment for testing

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Authentication enforced on all endpoints
- [ ] CORS configured for production domain only
- [ ] Rate limiting via Redis
- [ ] All security tests passing
- [ ] Production deployed on Netlify
- [ ] First venue onboarded
- [ ] Analytics tracking enabled
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Support channel established

## Competitive Advantage

- **First-mover**: No direct TikTok-to-venue booking tool exists
- **Data-driven**: Quantify viral momentum
- **Speed**: Book artists before they blow up
- **Network effects**: More venues = more valuable

## 7-Day Sprint Plan

- **Day 1**: Security fixes (8 hours)
- **Day 2**: Redis & rate limiting (8 hours)
- **Day 3**: Production deployment (8 hours)
- **Day 4**: First venue onboarding (8 hours)
- **Day 5**: Monitor, fix, iterate (8 hours)
- **Day 6-7**: Get 2 more venues, gather feedback

## Revenue Model (Future)
- SaaS: $299/month per venue
- Transaction fee: 2% of booking value
- Premium analytics: $99/month add-on
- Target: 100 venues in Year 1 = $30K MRR
