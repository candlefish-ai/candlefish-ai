## 🚦 Deployment Workflow

### Standard Deployment Process

1. **Developer creates PR** → Triggers preview deployment
2. **PR merged to `develop`** → Deploys to staging environment
3. **Staging validation** → Automated testing and manual QA
4. **PR to `main`** → Production deployment with blue-green strategy
5. **Health checks** → Automated validation and traffic switching
6. **Monitoring** → Continuous observability and alerting

### Emergency Procedures

**For Critical Issues:**
```bash
# Immediate rollback to previous version
./deployment/scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production --force

# Component-specific rollback
./deployment/scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production --component graphql-api

# Rollback to specific version
./deployment/scripts/emergency-rollback.sh production --to-version v1.2.3
```

**For Secrets Rotation:**
```bash
# Rotate JWT secret with zero downtime
./deployment/scripts/manage-secrets.sh rotate --environment production --secret-name JWT_SECRET

# Emergency secrets rotation
./deployment/scripts/manage-secrets.sh rotate --environment production --secret-name DATABASE_PASSWORD
```
