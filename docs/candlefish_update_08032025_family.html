        <h2>Quick Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We're exploring creating a family technology business (Candlefish AI) that could help us work together in the future</li>
            <li>This is an open conversation – nothing is set in stone, and we want your input</li>
            <li>Our goal is to create opportunities that support our family's growth and creativity</li>
            <li>We're thinking long-term about how we can collaborate and support each other</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Why Are We Having This Conversation?</h2>
        <p>Family is about more than just being related – it's about supporting each other's dreams and creating opportunities together. Right now, Dad is doing exciting work in technology that could open up amazing paths for all of us.</p>

        <p>Think of this like planning a big family road trip. We're not saying we're leaving our current "route" (jobs/schools), but we're discussing potential exciting destinations we might explore together.</p>

        <h2>What is Candlefish AI?</h2>
        <p>Candlefish AI is like a family workshop where we could potentially combine our skills to create something meaningful. Imagine a space where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tyler's problem-solving skills meet technology</li>
            <li>Kendall's creative thinking gets applied to innovation</li>
            <li>Trevor's technical knowledge finds new applications</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Right now, it's more of a conversation and a possibility than a concrete plan. We're exploring, not committing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
        <p>Any future work together would be guided by these principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Individual Growth: Everyone's personal development comes first</li>
            <li>Mutual Support: We help each other, but don't pressure each other</li>
            <li>Open Communication: No secrets, lots of discussions</li>
            <li>Respect for Individual Paths: Your current and future goals matter most</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions We Anticipate</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Do I have to join this?</dt>
            <dd>Absolutely not. This is an invitation to explore, not an obligation.</dd>

            <dt>Will this affect my current job/school?</dt>
            <dd>No. This is a potential future opportunity, not something that changes your current situation.</dd>

            <dt>What if I'm not interested?</dt>
            <dd>That's completely okay. This conversation is about keeping our options open, not forcing a path.</dd>

            <dt>How serious is this right now?</dt>
            <dd>Think of it like a family brainstorming session. We're just talking and exploring possibilities.</dd>
