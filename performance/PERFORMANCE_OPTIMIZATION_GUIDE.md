# Candlefish AI Performance Optimization Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide provides comprehensive performance optimizations for the Candlefish AI platform, targeting:
- API response time < 200ms for reads
- Frontend Lighthouse score > 90
- Time to First Byte < 600ms
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Bundle size reduction of 40%

## Current Performance Metrics

### Baseline Measurements (Before Optimization)
- Average API Response Time: ~800ms
- PDF Generation Time: ~3-5 seconds
- Frontend Bundle Size: ~2.4MB
- Lighthouse Score: ~65
- Database Query Time: ~200-500ms per query
- Cold Start Time: ~8-12 seconds

## Optimization Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
1. Enable Redis caching for all API endpoints
2. Implement database connection pooling
3. Add CDN for static assets
4. Enable Next.js image optimization
5. Implement lazy loading for components

### Phase 2: Database Optimization (Week 2)
1. Add proper indexes to PostgreSQL
2. Implement query optimization
3. Enable TimescaleDB for time-series data
4. Add materialized views for complex queries
5. Implement database query caching

### Phase 3: Frontend Optimization (Week 3)
1. Code splitting and dynamic imports
2. Bundle size optimization
3. Service worker implementation
4. Progressive Web App features
5. React component memoization

### Phase 4: Infrastructure Scaling (Week 4)
1. Horizontal scaling configuration
2. Load balancer setup
3. Auto-scaling policies
4. Monitoring and alerting
5. Performance testing automation
