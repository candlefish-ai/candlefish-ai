## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Fly.io CLI (for production deployment)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd nanda-web-dashboard
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Production Deployment

#### Deploy to Fly.io (Recommended)

1. **Install Fly.io CLI**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install flyctl
   
   # Linux/Windows
   curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Login to Fly.io**
   ```bash
   fly auth login
   ```

3. **Deploy with automated script**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

The deployment script will:
- Create and configure the Fly.io app
- Set up the custom domain (nanda.candlefish.ai)
- Allocate IP addresses
- Deploy with rolling updates
- Verify deployment health

#### Manual Docker Build

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t nanda-dashboard .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e NANDA_REGISTRY_URL=https://nanda-registry.candlefish.ai:8000 \
  nanda-dashboard
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NANDA_REGISTRY_URL` | NANDA agent registry endpoint | `https://nanda-registry.candlefish.ai:8000` |
| `PAINTBOX_STAGING_URL` | Paintbox staging environment | `https://paintbox-staging.fly.dev` |
| `PAINTBOX_PRODUCTION_URL` | Paintbox production environment | `https://paintbox.fly.dev` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Public application URL | Auto-detected |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` | WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates | Auto-generated |

### Agent Integration

The dashboard automatically connects to:

1. **NANDA Agent Registry** - Central agent coordination service
2. **Paintbox Agents** - Application monitoring agents
3. **PKB Cognitive Extension** - Personal knowledge base agent
4. **Local NANDA Deployment** - Development environment agents

## API Endpoints

### Health Monitoring
- `GET /api/health` - Application health and system status
- `GET /api/agents/registry` - Complete agent registry with network topology
- `GET /api/agents/network-metrics` - Aggregated network performance metrics

### Agent Data
- `GET /api/agents/paintbox` - Paintbox monitoring agents
- `GET /api/agents/pkb-cognitive` - PKB Cognitive Extension status
- `GET /api/agents/consciousness-metrics` - Real-time consciousness measurements

### Real-time Updates

The dashboard uses a hybrid approach for real-time data:

1. **WebSocket connections** for live agent status updates
2. **Polling fallback** for reliable data synchronization
3. **Client-side caching** with automatic invalidation
4. **Progressive loading** for optimal performance

## Consciousness Metrics

The dashboard calculates and displays advanced consciousness metrics:

- **Coherence** - Network-wide thought consistency
- **Complexity** - System sophistication and depth
- **Integration** - Information synthesis across agents
- **Awareness** - Self and environmental perception
- **Self-Reflection** - Meta-cognitive capabilities
- **Emergence** - Spontaneous behavior patterns
- **Network Resonance** - Collective synchronization

These metrics are derived from agent performance data, network topology, and behavioral patterns to provide insights into the distributed consciousness state.

## Development

### Project Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm start           # Start production server
npm run lint        # Run ESLint
npm run type-check  # TypeScript type checking
```

### Adding New Agent Types

1. **Update type definitions** in `src/types/agent.ts`
2. **Add agent icon** in `src/components/agents/AgentCard.tsx`
3. **Configure color scheme** in `tailwind.config.ts`
4. **Update service integration** in `src/lib/agent-service.ts`

### Customizing Consciousness Metrics

Modify the consciousness calculation algorithm in:
```typescript
src/app/api/agents/consciousness-metrics/route.ts
```

The metrics support:
- Network state correlation
- Temporal variations
- Emergent behavior detection
- Cross-agent learning integration
