## Cost Management

### Viewing Costs

- **On-demand**: Run the "Claude Cost Report" workflow
- **Slack integration**: Get daily summaries in Slack

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Use incremental reviews** for PR updates
2. **Use quick reviews** for small changes
3. **Skip generated files** with patterns
4. **Batch reviews** for multiple small PRs

## Advanced Features

### File Filtering

Skip files by pattern:

```
/claude-review skip:*.generated.ts,dist/*,*.min.js
```

Default skip patterns include:

- Lock files (`*.lock`, `package-lock.json`)
- Minified files (`*.min.js`, `*.min.css`)
- Build outputs (`dist/*`, `build/*`)
- Generated files (`*.generated.*`)
- Binary files (images, fonts)

### Incremental Reviews

When a PR is updated after a review:

```
/claude-review incremental
```

This only reviews files changed since the last Claude review, saving tokens and cost.

### Batch Reviews

Review multiple PRs efficiently:

1. Go to Actions â†’ "Claude Batch PR Review"
2. Enter PR numbers: `123,124,125`
3. Select review type and depth

The system will:

- Review PRs concurrently (respecting rate limits)
