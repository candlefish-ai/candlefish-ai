# Claude Resources Organization-Wide Sharing System - Project Context

## Project Overview
**Date**: August 4, 2025  
**Status**: Implementation Complete, Ready for Deployment  
**Purpose**: Create a centralized system for sharing Claude agents and commands across all Candlefish projects and team members

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Central Repository**: `candlefish/claude-resources`
   - Contains all agents from https://github.com/wshobson/agents
   - Contains all commands from https://github.com/wshobson/commands
   - Auto-syncs every 6 hours via GitHub Actions
   - PR-based review process with Aaron and Tyler as reviewers

2. **Distribution System**
   - GitHub Actions workflows propagate resources to all projects
   - Reusable workflow pattern for consistency
   - Automatic PR creation for transparency

3. **Local Developer Experience**
   - One-time setup script creates ~/.claude symlink
   - Git worktree support built-in
   - Auto-update reminders in shell profile
   - Zero manual configuration for new projects

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### 1. Symlink-Based Distribution
**Decision**: Use symlinks from ~/.claude to organization repository  
**Rationale**: 
- Instant updates when pulling claude-resources repo
- No duplication of files across projects
- Works seamlessly with Git worktrees
- Simple rollback by changing symlink

### 2. GitHub Actions for Automation
**Decision**: Use GitHub Actions for all sync and distribution  
**Rationale**:
- Native GitHub integration
- No external dependencies
- Built-in secret management
- Reusable workflows across projects

### 3. PR-Based Review Process
**Decision**: All updates create PRs for review  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures quality control
- Allows custom modifications
- Provides audit trail
- Enables rollback if needed

### 4. Upstream Repository Structure
**Decision**: Mirror upstream structure in .claude directory  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains compatibility
- Easy to track changes
- Allows selective syncing
- Preserves upstream organization

### API Design (Future Enhancement)
- RESTful API for programmatic access
- PostgreSQL for sync history and status
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Frontend Dashboard (Future Enhancement)
- React/TypeScript deployment dashboard
- Real-time sync progress monitoring
- One-click deployment actions
- Team member onboarding wizard

### Production Infrastructure (Future Enhancement)
- Docker containers with multi-stage builds
- Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
- Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
- Terraform infrastructure as code

## Key Workflows

### 1. Initial Setup (One-Time)
```bash
# For implementer
gh repo create candlefish/claude-resources --private
cd claude-resources-setup && cp -r * ../claude-resources/
cd ../claude-resources && git add . && git commit -m "Initial setup" && git push

# For team members
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/candlefish/claude-resources/main/scripts/setup-local.sh | bash
```

### 2. Upstream Sync (Automated)
- Runs every 6 hours via cron schedule
- Creates PR with changes for review
- Aaron and Tyler review and merge
- Changes propagate to all projects

### 3. Project Integration (Automated)
- Each project has sync workflow
- Pulls from claude-resources repository
- Updates .claude directory
- No manual intervention needed

### 4. Git Worktree Support
- setup-worktree-claude.sh handles all worktrees
- Creates symlinks in each worktree
- Works with existing and new worktrees
- Optional post-checkout hook available

## Security Considerations

1. **Repository Access**
   - Private repository for claude-resources
   - Team members need read access
   - Write access limited to maintainers

2. **Secret Management**
   - No secrets in claude-resources
   - GitHub Actions use GITHUB_TOKEN
   - No API keys or credentials stored

3. **Code Review**
   - All updates go through PR review
   - Two reviewers required (Aaron, Tyler)
   - Automated security scanning possible

## Maintenance Procedures

### Daily
- Automatic syncs run every 6 hours
- No manual intervention required

### Weekly
- Review pending sync PRs
- Check for failed workflows
- Monitor team feedback

### Monthly
- Review custom additions
- Update documentation
- Audit resource usage

### Quarterly
- Evaluate sync frequency
- Plan feature enhancements
- Security audit

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**
   - All team members using shared resources
   - Zero manual setup complaints
   - Positive feedback on workflow

2. **Reliability**
   - 99%+ successful sync rate
   - <5 minute sync duration
   - Zero data loss incidents

3. **Efficiency**
   - One-time setup per developer
   - Automatic updates
   - No manual file copying

## Future Enhancements

1. **Web Dashboard**
   - Visual sync status
   - Resource browser
   - Team analytics

2. **API Access**
   - Programmatic resource access
   - Integration with CI/CD
   - Custom tooling support

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Resource versioning
   - Rollback capabilities
   - A/B testing for agents

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **"~/.claude not found"**
   - Run setup-local.sh script
   - Check symlink exists
   - Verify repository cloned

2. **"Sync workflow failing"**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs
   - Verify repository permissions
   - Review error messages

3. **"Updates not appearing"**
   - Pull claude-resources repo
   - Check symlink target
   - Verify workflow running
