## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Immediate Actions (Required)

```bash
# 1. Create GitHub repository
gh repo create candlefish/claude-resources \
  --private \
  --description "Shared Claude agents and commands for all Candlefish projects"

# 2. Push the code
cp -r claude-resources-setup/* claude-resources/
cd claude-resources
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup of Claude resources system"
git push origin main

# 3. Configure repository settings
# - Add Aaron and Tyler as reviewers
# - Enable branch protection on main
# - Configure Actions permissions

# 4. Trigger first sync
gh workflow run sync-upstream.yml

# 5. Distribute to team
# Share this command with all team members:
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/candlefish/claude-resources/main/scripts/setup-local.sh | bash
```

### Optional Future Deployment (When Needed)

```bash
# Deploy infrastructure (if using API/Dashboard)
cd terraform
terraform init && terraform apply

# Deploy to Kubernetes (if using container platform)
kubectl apply -k k8s/production/

# Setup monitoring (if needed)
kubectl apply -f monitoring/
```

## 👥 Team Actions

### For Aaron & Tyler (Reviewers)
1. Accept repository invitation as reviewers
2. Review first sync PR from upstream
