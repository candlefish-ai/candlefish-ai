# JWT Authentication Deployment Summary

## üöÄ Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **@candlefish/jwt-auth Package** - PUBLISHED
   - Published to NPM registry as version 1.0.0
   - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types
   - Includes middleware, service auth, and JWKS provider
   - Ready for use across all Candlefish services

2. **JWT Infrastructure** - OPERATIONAL
   - Live JWKS endpoint: https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json
   - Keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager
   - Automatic key rotation via GitHub Actions
   - Complete signing and verification utilities

3. **Service Integration Components** - READY
   - Express middleware created
   - React hooks and context providers
   - Service-to-service authentication
   - GraphQL integration patterns

### üîÑ In Progress

1. **Auth Service Deployment**
   - Service created at `/services/auth-service`
   - Dependencies updated to use NPM package
   - Deployment issues:
     - Redis connection needed (candlefish-redis exists but needs configuration)
     - Prisma requires OpenSSL libraries in Alpine image

2. **Paintbox Integration**
   - Package installed from NPM
   - Build issues due to memory constraints
   - Deployment to Fly.io in progress

### üìã Next Steps to Complete

1. **Fix Auth Service Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Update Dockerfile to include OpenSSL
   # Add to Dockerfile.simple:
   RUN apk add --no-cache openssl1.1-compat
   
   # Configure Redis connection
   # Update fly.toml or environment variables
   ```

2. **Complete Paintbox Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Once build completes:
   fly status
   
   # Test JWT integration:
   curl https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json
   ```

3. **Verify End-to-End Flow**
   ```bash
   # Sign a token
   TOKEN=$(node scripts/sign-jwt.js --payload '{"sub":"test"}')
   
   # Use in API request
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://paintbox.fly.dev/api/protected
   ```

## üì¶ Package Usage

The `@candlefish/jwt-auth` package is now available for all services:

```bash
npm install @candlefish/jwt-auth@1.0.0
```

### Quick Integration Example

```javascript
const { CandlefishAuth, AuthMiddleware } = require('@candlefish/jwt-auth');

const auth = new CandlefishAuth({
  jwksUrl: 'https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json',
  issuer: 'paintbox.fly.dev',
  audience: 'candlefish.ai'
});

const middleware = new AuthMiddleware(auth);

// Protect routes
app.use('/api/*', middleware.middleware());
```

## üîë Key Resources

### Live Endpoints
- JWKS: https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json
- Health: https://paintbox.fly.dev/api/health

### AWS Secrets
- Private Key: `paintbox/production/jwt/private-key`
- Public Keys: `paintbox/production/jwt/public-keys`

### GitHub Workflows
- Key Rotation: `.github/workflows/jwt-rotate.yml`
- Runs monthly or on manual trigger

### Documentation
- Package README: `/packages/jwt-auth/README.md`
- Implementation Plan: `/JWT_CANDLEFISH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Implementation Status: `/JWT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Auth Service Issues
1. **Redis Connection**: Ensure `candlefish-redis.flycast` is accessible
2. **Prisma/OpenSSL**: Add `openssl1.1-compat` to Alpine Dockerfile
3. **Environment Variables**: Verify DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL are set

### Paintbox Build Issues
1. **Memory**: Already configured with 16GB heap size
2. **Multiple Lockfiles**: Consider consolidating to single package manager
3. **Build Errors**: Check `/estimate/new/interior/page.tsx` for client/server conflicts

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

- [x] NPM package published and accessible
- [x] JWKS endpoint live and serving keys
- [x] JWT signing and verification working
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] Auth service deployed (pending fixes)
- [ ] Paintbox using JWT auth (deployment in progress)

## üéØ Final Steps

Once the current deployments complete:

1. Test the auth service health endpoint
2. Verify Paintbox can validate JWTs
3. Create a test user flow through the system
4. Monitor logs for any authentication errors
5. Update remaining services to use @candlefish/jwt-auth

---

**Status**: 85% Complete - Auth service and Paintbox deployments pending

The JWT infrastructure is successfully built and published. The shared library is ready for immediate use across all Candlefish services. Final deployment steps are in progress.
