# Candlefish AI Family Discussion - Talking Points

## Overview
This document provides talking points for discussing the Candlefish AI family business structure. Remember: the written letter is just a starting point—the real value comes from open discussion.

## Key Messages to Emphasize

### 1. This is a Journey We're Taking Together
- "We're building something as a family, not just a business"
- "Your input shapes how we structure this"
- "Nothing is locked in stone—we can adjust as we learn"

### 2. Current Structure is Temporary
- "The 100% ownership thing is just because of Morgan Stanley rules"
- "We've already planned how to share ownership when the time is right"
- "Think of current structure as a regulatory requirement, not our choice"

### 3. Everyone Has a Place
- "Whether you work in the business or not, you're an owner"
- "There's no pressure to join—follow your own path"
- "Active participation is rewarded, but passive ownership is respected"

## Anticipated Questions & Suggested Responses

### "Why can't Karen be an owner now?"
**Response:** "It's frustrating, but Morgan Stanley has strict rules about employee investments. It's like having a non-compete clause. The second those restrictions lift, she becomes an equal partner automatically. We've already built that into the legal structure."

### "What if I don't want to work in tech?"
**Response:** "Perfect! You can be an owner without being an employee. Think of it like owning Apple stock—you don't need to work at Apple to benefit when it does well. Follow your passion, and this can be a nice additional asset."

### "What happens if the business fails?"
**Response:** "Then we tried something together and learned from it. The structure is designed so business failure doesn't create family problems. We dust ourselves off and maybe try something else. The family relationships are what matter most."

### "This seems complicated"
**Response:** "You're right, it can feel that way. The complexity is mostly to satisfy legal and tax requirements. The core idea is simple: we're building a business together where everyone has a fair stake. We can go as deep into details as you want, or keep it high-level."

### "How much money are we talking about?"
**Response:** "Honestly, we don't know yet. We haven't made our first dollar of revenue. This could become very valuable, or it might not. The structure ensures that if it does succeed, everyone benefits fairly. Think of it as planting seeds together."

### "Why these specific industries (trophy shops, painters, etc.)?"
**Response:** "These are businesses that need help with technology but are often overlooked by big tech companies. We see an opportunity to make a real difference. But we're flexible—if we discover better opportunities, we'll pivot."

## Topics to Save for Later

Some topics are better addressed in follow-up conversations:

1. **Specific equity percentages** - "Let's get the concept right first"
2. **Exact compensation numbers** - "We'll benchmark against industry standards"
3. **Tax implications** - "We'll have our accountant explain this properly"
4. **Legal details** - "Poppy can walk through the fine print"

## Managing Difficult Moments

### If someone seems overwhelmed:
"I know this is a lot to take in. We don't need to figure it all out today. What's the one thing you'd most like to understand better?"

### If there's disagreement:
"That's a great point. Let's note that as something to work through. The beauty is we can design this to work for everyone."

### If someone feels pressured:
"I want to be clear: there's zero pressure here. This is about creating options, not obligations. Your relationship with the family doesn't depend on your involvement in the business."

## Closing the Conversation

### Wrap-up Points:
1. "Thank you for engaging with this openly"
2. "Your questions and concerns help make this better"
3. "Let's think about it and talk again soon"
4. "Remember, we're building this together"

### Next Steps:
1. "I'll have Poppy review the legal structure"
2. "Let's plan another discussion after you've had time to think"
3. "Please bring any new questions as they come up"
4. "We'll refine based on everyone's input"

## Follow-up Actions

After the discussion:
1. Send thank-you text to each participant
2. Document questions that need research
3. Schedule follow-up conversations
4. Update structure based on feedback
5. Keep Poppy in the loop

## Remember

The goal isn't to "sell" them on the idea—it's to explore together whether and how this makes sense for our family. Their concerns and hesitations are valuable input, not obstacles to overcome.
