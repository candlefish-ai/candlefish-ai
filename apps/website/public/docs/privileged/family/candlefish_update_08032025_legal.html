        <div class="date">August 4, 2025</div>
    </div>

    <p>TO: Mike McIntosh, General Counsel<br>
    FROM: Patrick Smith<br>
    RE: Proposed Family Business Structure - Legal Review</p>

    <div class="legal-notice">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This document outlines the proposed studio structure for Candlefish.ai Studio, with particular attention to regulatory compliance requirements during the founders' employment at Morgan Stanley. The Studio model emphasizes creative technology development across multiple verticals.
    </div>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>This memorandum proposes a studio structure for Candlefish.ai Studio that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintains compliance with SEC Rule 204A-1<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> and FINRA Rule 3210<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup></li>
        <li>Provides for orderly transition of ownership upon change in employment status</li>
        <li>Establishes clear governance and operational boundaries</li>
        <li>Protects family interests while maintaining business flexibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Current Status and Regulatory Context</h2>
    <p>Candlefish AI is currently pre-revenue with active business development efforts underway. Due to Karen Smith's and my continued employment at Morgan Stanley, we are subject to regulatory restrictions that require careful structuring of any outside business activities.</p>
    
    <p>Specifically, FINRA Rule 3210 requires prior written notice to the member firm before engaging in outside business activities, and SEC regulations impose restrictions on securities-related activities by associated persons of investment advisers. To maintain full compliance, I currently hold 100% ownership of Candlefish.ai Holdings LLC.</p>

    <h2>Proposed Ownership Structure</h2>
    <p>The ownership structure is designed to transition based on employment status:</p>
    
    <h3>Phase 1: During Morgan Stanley Employment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Patrick Smith: 100% ownership of Candlefish.ai Holdings LLC</li>
        <li>Structure: Single-member LLC for simplicity and compliance</li>
        <li>Rationale: Maintains clear compliance boundaries</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Phase 2: Post-Employment Transition</h3>
    <p>Upon both Karen's and my departure from Morgan Stanley (timing hypothetical and not predetermined):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Karen and Patrick Smith: Equal majority control (combined 70-80%)</li>
        <li>Tyler Robinson, Kendall, and Trevor Smith: Remaining equity (20-30% divided equally)</li>
        <li>Implementation: Operating Agreement amendment triggered by employment status change</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Corporate Structure</h2>
    <h3>Current Structure: Single LLC During Morgan Stanley Employment</h3>
    <p>During MS employment period (through ~2027):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Single entity: Candlefish.ai Studio LLC (Colorado)</li>
        <li>100% owned by Patrick Smith</li>
        <li>Simplified structure to avoid MS disclosure requirements</li>
        <li>All operations consolidated under one entity</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Future Structure: Multi-Entity Post-MS Employment</h3>
    <p>Post-MS transition (targeting 2027):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Convert to Delaware LLC for favorable business law framework</li>
        <li>Parent entity: Candlefish.ai Studio Holdings LLC</li>
        <li>Houses all intellectual property, trademarks, and core technology</li>
        <li>Pass-through taxation via Schedule K-1 distributions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Subsidiary Entities</h3>
    <p>Each vertical market operates through a separate subsidiary LLC:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Candlefish.ai Trophy LLC</li>
        <li>Candlefish.ai Paint LLC</li>
        <li>Candlefish.ai Brewery LLC</li>
        <li>Additional subsidiaries as markets develop</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This structure provides:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Legal liability isolation between business units</li>
        <li>Clear financial reporting and performance tracking</li>
        <li>Flexibility for unit-specific partnerships or exits</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Governance Framework</h2>
    <h3>Management Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Managing Member (Patrick Smith): Day-to-day operational decisions</li>
        <li>Annual Family Board Meeting: Major strategic decisions</li>
        <li>Decisions requiring family approval:
            <ul>
                <li>Launch of new subsidiaries</li>
                <li>Sale of equity exceeding 20% in any entity</li>
                <li>Compensation structure modifications</li>
                <li>Full or partial exit transactions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Employment and Compensation</h2>
    <h3>Active Participation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tyler Robinson: Contingent employee - employment and compensation contingent upon Studio revenue generation. Will continue employment at Advantage Capital until Studio can support market-rate compensation</li>
        <li>Other family members: May join as employees or consultants at market rates</li>
        <li>Compensation methodology: Third-party benchmarking to ensure arm's length terms</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Extended Family Strategic Roles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scotty Smith (Brother-in-law)</strong>: 
            <ul>
                <li>Role: COO/CFO (Chief Operating Officer / Chief Financial Officer)</li>
                <li>Currently MS employee - will maintain separate LLC during MS employment</li>
                <li>Profit Interest Range: 5-10% of Studio profits (non-dilutive to family ownership)</li>
                <li>Engagement: Advisory/consulting basis until post-MS transition</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mike McIntosh (Father-in-law)</strong>:
            <ul>
                <li>Role: General Counsel</li>
                <li>Profit Interest Range: 5-10% of Studio profits (non-dilutive to family ownership)</li>
                <li>Engagement: Hourly consulting arrangement with potential for equity participation</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Nuclear family (Patrick, Karen, Tyler Robinson, Kendall, Trevor) maintains 100% voting control and ownership. Extended family members receive profit participation only.</p>
    
    <h3>Passive Ownership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Profit distributions based on ownership percentages</li>
        <li>No employment requirement for ownership retention</li>
        <li>Anti-dilution provisions for family members</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Financial Structure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Revenue flows to operational subsidiaries</li>
        <li>Management fee (15-20%) paid to parent company for shared services</li>
        <li>Annual profit distributions after reserve requirements</li>
        <li>No cross-subsidization between subsidiaries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risk Management</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Key person life insurance on Patrick Smith</li>
        <li>Buy-sell agreement funded by insurance proceeds</li>
        <li>Annual third-party CPA review</li>
        <li>Annual legal compliance review</li>
        <li>Quarterly board reporting requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exit Strategies</h2>
    <p>The structure accommodates multiple exit scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Individual subsidiary sales with parent company royalty/carry</li>
        <li>Strategic minority investments (capped at 20% per subsidiary)</li>
        <li>Full portfolio acquisition</li>
        <li>Family buyout provisions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Delaware vs Colorado LLC Analysis</h2>
    <h3>Current: Colorado LLC (During MS Employment)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Simpler compliance and reporting requirements</li>
        <li>Lower formation and maintenance costs</li>
        <li>Adequate for single-member LLC structure</li>
        <li>Local registered agent readily available</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Future: Delaware LLC (Post-MS Employment, ~2027)</h3>
    <p><strong>Why Delaware conversion makes sense post-MS:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Superior business law jurisprudence and Court of Chancery</li>
        <li>More flexible operating agreement provisions</li>
        <li>Better for multi-member LLC with complex profit sharing</li>
        <li>Preferred by institutional investors and acquirers</li>
        <li>Enhanced privacy protections for members</li>
        <li>Series LLC option for subsidiary structure</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Timing:</strong> Conversion to Delaware LLC should occur after MS employment ends to avoid additional compliance complexity during employment period.</p>

        <li>Version Control: Git for code/technical documents</li>
        <li>Legal Documents: Separate encrypted vault with audit trail</li>
