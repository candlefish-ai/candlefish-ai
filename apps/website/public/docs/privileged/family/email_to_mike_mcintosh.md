# Email to Mike McIntosh - Legal Review Request

**Subject:** Candlefish AI Structure - Legal Review Request

Mike,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request your legal review of the proposed corporate structure for Candlefish AI, our family's new venture into AI-powered business management software.

## Background

As you know, Karen and I are exploring ways to build a sustainable family business that can involve our children (Tyler, Kendall, and Trevor) while navigating the compliance requirements of our current employment at Morgan Stanley. We've drafted a structure that we believe balances several key objectives:

1. **Regulatory Compliance** - Maintaining strict adherence to SEC and FINRA rules during our Morgan Stanley employment
2. **Family Unity** - Ensuring fair participation opportunities for all three children
3. **Business Flexibility** - Allowing for growth and potential exits without compromising family relationships
4. **Risk Management** - Protecting family assets through proper entity structuring

## Documents for Review

I've prepared two versions of our family communication:

1. **Legal Review Version** (`candlefish_update_08032025_legal.html`) - Contains full regulatory context, legal terminology, and compliance framework for your review
   - Password: candlefish

2. **Family Version** (`candlefish_update_08032025_family.html`) - Simplified version for the kids that we'd share after incorporating your feedback
   - Password: candlefish

Both documents are available at: [https://candlefish.ai/docs/privileged/family/](https://candlefish.ai/docs/privileged/family/)

## Key Areas for Your Review

I'd particularly appreciate your thoughts on:

### 1. Regulatory Compliance

- Is our interpretation of SEC Rule 204A-1 and FINRA Rule 3210 accurate?
- Are there additional compliance considerations we should address?
- Should we be more or less specific about hypothetical timing for employment changes?

### 2. Corporate Structure

- Does the parent/subsidiary model provide adequate liability protection?
- Are there tax implications we should consider more carefully?
- Is the proposed ownership transition mechanism legally sound?

### 3. Family Governance

- Are the proposed decision-making rights appropriately balanced?
- Should we consider additional protections for minority family shareholders?
- Do we need more formal buy-sell provisions?

### 4. Risk Mitigation

- Is key person insurance sufficient, or should we consider additional protections?
- Are there other contingencies we should plan for?
- Should we establish an independent advisory board sooner?

## Specific Concerns from Karen

Karen has raised several important points that I wanted to flag:

1. **Terminology** - She correctly notes that terms like "spine" and "pod" may be confusing. I've revised these in the legal version, but please let me know if the business unit structure needs clearer definition.

2. **Timing References** - She's concerned about documenting specific resignation timelines. I've made these hypothetical in both versions, but please advise on the appropriate level of vagueness vs. clarity.

3. **Communication Approach** - She emphasizes that written documents alone aren't sufficient for family understanding. I've created talking points for live discussions, but would appreciate your thoughts on the legal sufficiency of verbal vs. written communications for family business matters.

## Timeline

We're hoping to discuss this with the children after your review, ideally within the next 2-3 weeks. However, there's no urgent deadlineâ€”getting it right is more important than moving quickly.

## Questions for You

1. Do you see any red flags in the proposed structure?
2. Are there protective provisions we should add for the children's interests?
3. Should we engage additional specialists (tax, estate planning) at this stage?
4. Would you recommend any changes to the documentation approach?

I'm happy to discuss this by phone at your convenience. As always, I deeply appreciate your guidance in ensuring we build something that protects and benefits the entire family.

Thank you for taking the time to review this. Your expertise and family perspective are invaluable in getting this right.

Best regards,

Patrick

P.S. - I've also prepared a talking points document for the family discussion, which I'd be happy to share if you think it would be helpful for your review.
