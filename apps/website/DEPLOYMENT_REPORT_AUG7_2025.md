  - projects/paintbox/terraform/.terraform/providers/

### Merge Conflicts
- **Resolved:** 3 conflicts in index.html (logo paths)
- **Resolved:** 1 conflict in netlify.toml (publish directory)
- **Strategy:** Accepted remote changes with relative paths

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Test authentication flow with actual password
2. ✅ Verify all 8 documents are accessible
3. ⚠️ Clean git history of large files (use git-filter-branch or BFG)

### Future Improvements
1. Add .gitignore entries for .terraform directories
2. Consider implementing proper user authentication system
3. Improve PWA score for better mobile experience
4. Set up automated testing for authentication flows
