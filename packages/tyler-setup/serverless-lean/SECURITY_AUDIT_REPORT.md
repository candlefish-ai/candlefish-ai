## Executive Summary

Three critical security vulnerabilities have been identified and fixed in the serverless employee setup system. These issues could have allowed unauthorized access, credential compromise, and data exposure.

---

## 1. BROKEN AUTHENTICATION - Password Hashing Mismatch [FIXED]

### Issue Details

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **OWASP Category**: A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures
- **Location**: `/src/handlers/users.js` lines 128-129

### Vulnerability

The system had a critical authentication failure:

- `users.js` was creating passwords using SHA-256 with salt
- `auth.js` was expecting Argon2 hashed passwords
- Result: No new users could successfully authenticate

### Security Impact

- Complete authentication bypass for new users
- SHA-256 is cryptographically broken for password storage
- Rainbow table attacks possible on SHA-256 hashes

### Fix Applied

```javascript
// BEFORE (INSECURE):
const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString('hex');
const passwordHash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(password + salt).digest('hex');

// AFTER (SECURE):
const { hashPassword } = await import('../utils/security.js');
const passwordHash = await hashPassword(password);
```

### Implementation Details

- Now using Argon2id algorithm (memory-hard, resistant to GPU attacks)
- Parameters: 64MB memory, 3 iterations, parallelism 1
- Salt automatically included in hash (no separate storage needed)
- Verified with test script: `test-auth-fix.js`

## 2. HARDCODED JWT SECRETS [FIXED]

### Issue Details

- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **OWASP Category**: A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures
- **Locations**:
  - `/src/utils/security.js` line 40
  - `/src/handlers/contractors.js` line 373

### Vulnerability

Hardcoded fallback JWT secrets in production code:

- `'temp-secret-change-in-production'` in security.js
- `'temp-secret'` in contractors.js
- Predictable secrets allow token forgery

### Security Impact

- Complete authentication bypass via forged tokens
- Session hijacking possible
- Privilege escalation attacks

### Fix Applied

#### security.js

```javascript
// BEFORE (INSECURE):
return process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'temp-secret-change-in-production';

// AFTER (SECURE):
throw new Error('JWT secret not available. Please ensure AWS Secrets Manager is properly configured.');
```

#### contractors.js

```javascript
// BEFORE (INSECURE):
crypto.createHmac('sha256', process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'temp-secret')

// AFTER (SECURE):
import { generateJwtToken } from '../utils/security.js';
return await generateJwtToken(payload, `${expiresIn}s`);
```

### Implementation Details

- JWT secrets now exclusively from AWS Secrets Manager
- No fallback values - fails securely if secrets unavailable
- Proper error handling and logging
- Using jsonwebtoken library instead of manual implementation

## 3. S3 BUCKET PUBLIC ACCESS MISCONFIGURATION [FIXED]

### Issue Details

- **Severity**: HIGH
- **OWASP Category**: A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
- **Location**: `serverless.yml` lines 362-366

### Vulnerability

S3 bucket with all public access blocks disabled:

```yaml
BlockPublicAcls: false
BlockPublicPolicy: false
IgnorePublicAcls: false
RestrictPublicBuckets: false
```

### Security Impact

- Potential data exposure
- Bucket takeover vulnerability
- Compliance violations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### Fix Applied

```yaml
PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
  BlockPublicAcls: true
  BlockPublicPolicy: false  # Allow bucket policy for static website hosting
  IgnorePublicAcls: true
  RestrictPublicBuckets: false  # Allow public access via bucket policy only
```

### Implementation Details

- Blocks direct public ACLs (more secure)
- Allows controlled access via bucket policy only
- Static website hosting still works through explicit bucket policy
- Prevents accidental public exposure of objects

---

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Deploy these changes immediately** to production
2. **Rotate all JWT secrets** in AWS Secrets Manager
3. **Force password reset** for all existing users (they're using SHA-256)
4. **Audit S3 bucket contents** for any sensitive data

### Additional Security Enhancements

1. **Implement rate limiting** on authentication endpoints
2. **Add MFA support** for administrative accounts
3. **Enable AWS CloudTrail** for audit logging
4. **Implement CORS restrictions** (currently allows all origins)
5. **Add input validation** using the existing Joi schemas
6. **Enable AWS WAF** for API Gateway protection

### Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] Test authentication with new user creation
- [ ] Verify existing users can still log in
- [ ] Confirm JWT generation works without fallback secrets
- [ ] Test contractor invitation flow
- [ ] Verify S3 static hosting still functions
- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs for any errors
- [ ] Rotate all secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] Update documentation with security requirements

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test Authentication Fix

```bash
# Run the provided test script
node test-auth-fix.js

# Create a new user via API and verify login works
```

### Test JWT Security

```bash
# Ensure AWS Secrets Manager is configured
# Attempt to start the service - it should fail if secrets are missing
# No hardcoded secrets should be in the codebase
```

### Test S3 Security

```bash
# Verify static website still accessible
# Attempt to upload via public ACL (should fail)
# Check bucket policy allows only GetObject on /*
```

---

## Compliance Notes

These fixes address requirements for:

- **PCI DSS**: Requirement 8.2.1 (strong cryptography for passwords)
- **GDPR**: Article 32 (appropriate technical measures)
- **SOC 2**: CC6.1 (logical and physical access controls)
- **HIPAA**: §164.312(a)(2)(iv) (encryption and decryption)

---

## Conclusion

All three critical security issues have been successfully remediated. The authentication system now uses industry-standard Argon2 hashing, JWT secrets are properly managed through AWS Secrets Manager, and S3 buckets are configured with appropriate access controls. Deploy these changes immediately to secure the production environment.
