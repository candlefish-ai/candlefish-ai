# PromoterOS 404 Error - RESOLVED

## Root Cause Analysis ✅

**Issue**: Site configuration mismatch between DNS and deployed site
- DNS correctly pointed `promoteros.candlefish.ai` → `promoteros.netlify.app`  
- Local project was linked to wrong site (`steady-cuchufli-1890bc` instead of `promoteros`)
- Custom domain was not configured on the target site

## Fixes Implemented ✅

### 1. Site Linking Corrected
```bash
# Unlinked from wrong site
netlify unlink

# Linked to correct site  
netlify link --id ef0d6f05-62ba-46dd-82ad-39afbaa267ae
```

### 2. Code Deployed to Correct Site
```bash
# Successfully deployed to promoteros.netlify.app
netlify deploy --prod
# Deploy URL: https://promoteros.netlify.app
```

### 3. Verified Site Content
- ✅ Direct URL works: https://promoteros.netlify.app returns HTTP 200
- ✅ Content matches local files (PromoterOS API interface)
- ✅ Functions deployed successfully (health endpoint active)

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- **Direct URL**: https://promoteros.netlify.app
- **DNS Resolution**: `promoteros.candlefish.ai` → `promoteros.netlify.app`
- **Site Content**: All files deployed correctly
- **API Functions**: Netlify Functions working

### Requires Manual Step ⚠️
- **Custom Domain SSL**: Need to add custom domain through web interface
- **Action Required**: Go to https://app.netlify.com/projects/promoteros/settings/domain

## Manual Configuration Steps

1. **Add Custom Domain (Required)**:
   - Visit: https://app.netlify.com/projects/promoteros/settings/domain
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter: `promoteros.candlefish.ai`
   - Confirm DNS is configured (already done)

2. **SSL Certificate Provisioning**:
   - Netlify will automatically provision SSL certificate
   - Takes 5-60 minutes after domain is added
   - No additional action required

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test direct URL (works now)
curl -I https://promoteros.netlify.app

# Test custom domain (will work after manual step)
curl -I https://promoteros.candlefish.ai

# Check DNS resolution (working)
nslookup promoteros.candlefish.ai
```

## Files Created/Modified

- **Fixed**: Site linking configuration
- **Created**: `/Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/projects/promoterOS/add-custom-domain.sh`
- **Created**: `/Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/projects/promoterOS/DEPLOYMENT_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

## Prevention Recommendations

1. **Site Verification**: Always verify `netlify status` shows correct site ID
2. **DNS Documentation**: Document which Netlify site ID corresponds to each custom domain
3. **Deployment Scripts**: Create scripts that verify site linkage before deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Set up uptime monitoring for custom domains

## Next Steps

After completing the manual domain addition:
1. SSL certificate will auto-provision (5-60 minutes)
2. https://promoteros.candlefish.ai will return HTTP 200
3. Site will be fully operational on custom domain

**Estimated Time to Resolution**: 5 minutes manual work + 5-60 minutes SSL provisioning
