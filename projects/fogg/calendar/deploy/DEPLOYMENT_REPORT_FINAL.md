## Recommendations

### For Production Use

1. **Always start with dry-run**: `./deploy/critical-deploy.sh --dry-run`
2. **Deploy to staging first**: Test all changes in staging environment
3. **Monitor metrics post-deployment**: Check application health and performance
4. **Keep rollback enabled**: Never disable for production deployments
5. **Review warnings**: Even successful deployments may have important warnings

### Best Practices

- Run deployments during low-traffic hours
- Maintain backup before database migrations
- Document any custom configurations
- Archive deployment reports for compliance
- Set up monitoring alerts for deployment events
