- **Real-time monitoring** and alerting
- **Complete documentation** for operations

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Staging**
   ```bash
   cd terraform/
   terraform apply -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars"
   ./scripts/secure-deploy.sh --environment staging
   ```

2. **Run Security Check**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/security-check.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor for 24 hours** in staging

4. **Deploy to Production** after successful staging validation
