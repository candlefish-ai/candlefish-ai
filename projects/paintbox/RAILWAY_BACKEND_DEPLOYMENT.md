# Railway Backend Deployment Summary

## Deployment Details
- **Date**: 2025-08-04
- **Service**: paintbox-backend
- **Environment**: production
- **URL**: https://paintbox-backend-production-82d8.up.railway.app

## What Was Done

1. **Configured Railway Project**
   - Used existing Railway project `paintbox-backend`
   - Configured for production environment

2. **Updated Environment Variables**
   - Updated `.env` file with production configurations
   - Set all required environment variables via Railway CLI:
     - Salesforce credentials (sandbox)
     - CompanyCam API tokens
     - Database and Redis URLs (to be provided by Railway)
     - Encryption keys
     - CORS origins including production domains

3. **Deployed Backend**
   - Ran `railway up` to deploy the backend
   - Environment variables configured automatically via script
   - Railway assigned domain: `paintbox-backend-production-82d8.up.railway.app`

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for Deployment to Complete**
   - The backend is currently building and deploying
   - Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
   - Typical deployment takes 2-5 minutes

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Test health endpoint: `curl https://paintbox-backend-production-82d8.up.railway.app/api/v1/health`
   - Check deployment logs: `railway logs`

3. **Add Database and Redis (if needed)**
   - Railway can provision PostgreSQL: `railway add`
   - Railway can provision Redis: `railway add`
   - These will automatically set DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL

4. **Update Frontend Configuration**
   - Update Netlify environment variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://paintbox-backend-production-82d8.up.railway.app`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://paintbox-backend-production-82d8.up.railway.app`

5. **Test Integration**
   - Test Salesforce integration
   - Test CompanyCam integration
   - Verify CORS is working with frontend domains

## Troubleshooting

If the backend shows 404 errors:
1. Wait for deployment to complete (check Railway dashboard)
2. Check logs: `railway logs`
3. Verify the start command in package.json
4. Ensure all environment variables are set
