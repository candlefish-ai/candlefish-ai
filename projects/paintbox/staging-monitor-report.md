# Staging Environment Monitoring Report

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**Environment**: https://paintbox-staging.fly.dev  
**Status**: Operational with Issues

## Performance Metrics

- **Uptime**: 219 seconds (3.6 minutes)
- **Memory Usage**: 95% (56MB of 60MB)
- **Response Time (TTFB)**: 2ms
- **Health Status**: Unhealthy (due to high memory)

## Golden Path Test Results

**Overall**: 13/14 tests passed (92.8% success rate)

### ✅ Passed Tests:
1. GP1: Create Estimate → Save to Client (3/3 passed)
2. GP2: Configure Exterior → Calculate Pricing (1/1 passed)
3. GP3: Configure Interior → Review (2/2 passed)
4. GP4: Salesforce Integration (1/1 passed)
5. GP6: Offline Mode (2/2 passed)
6. GP7: Real-time Updates (2/2 passed)
7. GP8: Mobile PWA (2/2 passed)

### ❌ Failed Tests:
- GP5: PDF Export (HTTP 500 error)

## Active Issues

### Critical:
1. **High Memory Usage** (95%)
   - Recommendation: Increase memory allocation or optimize memory usage

### Medium:
1. **PDF Generation Failure** (HTTP 500)
   - Endpoint: `/estimate/test-id/pdf`
   - Likely due to missing dependencies or configuration

2. **JWKS AWS Authentication**
   - Error: "The security token included in the request is invalid"
   - AWS credentials may need refresh or proper IAM permissions

### Low:
1. **IndexedDB Warning** (Server-side only, expected)
2. **Redis Not Configured** (Using in-memory cache)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Increase Fly.io machine memory from 1GB to 2GB
2. Fix AWS credential configuration for JWKS
3. Debug PDF generation endpoint

### Before Production:
1. Configure Redis for proper caching
2. Optimize memory usage in application
3. Fix all remaining GAP report items
4. Set up proper monitoring and alerting

## Log Patterns

Common warnings observed:
- "Using in-memory cache service (Redis not configured)"
- "IndexedDB API missing" (expected on server)
- "The security token included in the request is invalid" (AWS)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ AWS credentials added (partial success)
2. ✅ Salesforce credentials configured
3. ✅ Golden Path tests executed (92.8% pass rate)
4. ✅ Performance monitoring completed
5. ⏳ Apply remaining GAP report fixes

## Conclusion

The staging environment is **functional but needs optimization**. Main concerns are memory usage and PDF generation. The application successfully handles most user journeys and integrations are partially working.
