# Excel Test Files Summary

These files were created to demonstrate and validate the Paintbox Excel calculation engine.

## Test Files:

### 1-testcase.xlsx - Basic arithmetic and simple formulas
- Basic addition, multiplication, division
- SUM function
- Text concatenation
- IF function with conditions
- Expected to pass 100% validation

### 2.xlsx - VLOOKUP and lookup functions  
- VLOOKUP with exact match
- Product price lookup scenarios
- Table-based data retrieval
- Tests lookup function accuracy

### 3.xlsx - Complex calculations and nested functions
- Tax calculations with percentages
- Conditional bulk discounts
- ROUND, MAX, MIN, AVERAGE functions
- Nested formula combinations

### 4.xlsx - Performance test with many calculations
- 50 rows of sequential calculations
- Dependent formulas (each row depends on previous)
- SUM, AVERAGE, MAX functions on large ranges
- Tests calculation speed and efficiency

### 5.xlsx - Integration scenarios similar to BART estimator
- Client information fields
- Area calculations (length Ã— height)
- Material and labor cost calculations
- Tax calculations
- Total estimate formula
- Mirrors real estimation workflow

## Running Tests:

```bash
npm run test:excel-validation
```

## Expected Results:
- All basic arithmetic should pass (100%)
- VLOOKUP functions should return correct values
- Complex calculations should match Excel results
- Performance tests should complete under 100ms total
- Integration scenarios should produce accurate estimates

## For KindHome:
These test files demonstrate the validation framework capabilities.
Replace with actual BART estimator scenarios for production validation.
