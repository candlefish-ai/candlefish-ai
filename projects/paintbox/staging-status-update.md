# Staging Environment Status Update

**Date**: 2025-08-22  
**URL**: https://paintbox-staging.fly.dev  
**Overall Status**: Partially Operational

## ✅ Working Components

1. **Infrastructure**
   - Fly.io deployment successful
   - 2GB memory allocated (upgraded from 1GB)
   - Health checks passing
   - Database persistent (SQLite with WAL)

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/health` - ✅ Working
   - `/api/telemetry/status` - ✅ Working
   - `/api/v1/salesforce/test` - ✅ Working
   - All API routes returning valid responses

3. **Static Pages**
   - Homepage - ✅ Fully functional
   - Login page - ✅ Accessible
   - Offline page - ✅ Working
   - PWA manifest - ✅ Available

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### Critical Issue: Estimate Creation Page
- **URL**: `/estimate/new`
- **Problem**: Stuck in perpetual loading state
- **Symptom**: Shows "Loading..." but never progresses
- **Impact**: Core functionality blocked
- **Root Cause**: Likely client-side hydration or state management issue

### Other Issues
1. **Memory Usage**: Still high at 92% despite 2GB allocation
2. **PDF Generation**: Returns HTTP 500 error
3. **AWS Credentials**: JWKS failing with "invalid security token"
4. **Client-Side Error**: "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred"

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ AWS credentials configured (partial - needs IAM fix)
2. ✅ Salesforce sandbox credentials set
3. ✅ Golden Path testing (13/14 passed)
4. ✅ Performance monitoring established
5. ✅ Memory increased from 1GB to 2GB
6. ✅ Production readiness checklist created

## Immediate Actions Needed

### Fix Estimate Page Loading Issue
The estimate creation workflow is the core functionality. This needs immediate attention:

1. **Check client-side console errors**
2. **Review state management in estimate components**
3. **Verify API calls from client to server**
4. **Check for missing environment variables**

### Potential Quick Fixes
```bash
# Check for client-side errors
fly ssh console -a paintbox-staging -C "grep -i error /app/.next/server/pages/*.js | head -20"

# Verify environment variables
fly secrets list --app paintbox-staging

# Check if all required services are initialized
curl https://paintbox-staging.fly.dev/api/status
```

## Summary

The staging environment is **partially operational**. The infrastructure and APIs are working, but the core estimate creation functionality is blocked by a client-side issue. This must be resolved before the application can be considered ready for production.

### Success Metrics
- Homepage: ✅ Working
- APIs: ✅ 100% operational
- Estimate Creation: ❌ Blocked
- Golden Paths: 92.8% passing
- Memory: ⚠️ High but stable

### Next Priority
**CRITICAL**: Debug and fix the estimate page loading issue. This is blocking the primary user workflow.
