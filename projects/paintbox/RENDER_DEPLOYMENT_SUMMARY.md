## Environment Variables Set

All secrets are configured in Render from AWS:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=âœ“
COMPANYCAM_API_KEY=âœ“
COMPANYCAM_COMPANY_ID=âœ“
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID=âœ“
SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET=âœ“
SALESFORCE_USERNAME=âœ“

```

## Deployment Configuration

- **Repository**: aspenas/candlefish-ai
- **Branch**: paintbox-deployment
- **Root Directory**: projects/paintbox
- **Build Command**: npm install && npm run build
- **Start Command**: npm start
- **Health Check**: /api/health

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
./check-deployment.sh

# Diagnose issues
./diagnose-render-issue.sh

# View dashboard
open https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d26n6mggjchc73e6pmu0
```

## Next Steps

1. Check the Render dashboard logs for any specific errors
2. The deployment infrastructure is fully configured
3. Once any remaining build issues are resolved, the app will be live at:
   **<https://paintbox-app.onrender.com>**

## Manual Deployment Option

If automated deployment continues to have issues:

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Check "Events" tab for specific errors
3. Adjust settings as needed
4. Or create a new service with manual configuration

All the groundwork is complete - the service just needs to successfully build and deploy!
