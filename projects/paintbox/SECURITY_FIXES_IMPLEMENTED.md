# Security Fixes Implementation Report

## Date: 2025-08-21
## Status: COMPLETED ✅

---

## CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES - FIXED

### 1. ✅ REMOVED HARDCODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS
**File:** `/app/api/.well-known/jwks.json/route.ts`

**What was fixed:**
- Removed hardcoded JWKS keys from source code
- Implemented secure emergency fallback mechanism using AWS backup regions
- Keys are now ONLY fetched from AWS Secrets Manager
- Emergency mode returns service unavailable (503) instead of exposing keys

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Emergency fallback now fetches from backup AWS region
async function getEmergencyJWKS(): Promise<JWKSResponse | null> {
  // Attempts backup AWS region
  // Returns null if unavailable (no hardcoded keys)
}
```

---

### 2. ✅ RESTRICTED CORS CONFIGURATION
**File:** `/app/api/.well-known/jwks.json/route.ts`

**What was fixed:**
- Replaced wildcard `*` with specific allowed origins
- Different origins for production vs development
- Dynamic origin validation based on request

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
  ? [
      'https://paintbox.fly.dev',
      'https://paintbox-app.fly.dev',
      'https://api.paintbox.fly.dev'
    ]
  : [
      'http://localhost:3000',
      'http://localhost:3001',
      'https://paintbox.fly.dev'
    ];
```

---

### 3. ✅ IMPLEMENTED RATE LIMITING
**Files:** 
- `/app/api/.well-known/jwks.json/route.ts`
- `/middleware.ts`
- `/lib/security/rate-limiter.ts`

**What was fixed:**
- Applied jwksRateLimiter (10 requests/minute per IP)
- Integrated rate limiting in middleware
- Different limits for different endpoints

**Rate Limits Applied:**
- JWKS endpoint: 10 requests/minute
- Auth endpoints: 5 requests/15 minutes
- General API: 100 requests/minute

---

### 4. ✅ ADDED COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY HEADERS
**Files:**
- `/next.config.js`
- `/middleware.ts`
- `/app/api/.well-known/jwks.json/route.ts`

**Headers Added:**
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP) with nonce-based scripts
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) - production only
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Permissions-Policy (disables unnecessary browser features)
- X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

---

### 5. ✅ REDUCED CACHE TTL
**File:** `/app/api/.well-known/jwks.json/route.ts`

**What was fixed:**
- Reduced cache TTL from 10 minutes to 5 minutes
- Emergency mode cache: 30 seconds
- Error cache: 30 seconds

```typescript
const CACHE_TTL = 300000; // 5 minutes (reduced from 10)
const CACHE_TTL_ERROR = 30000; // 30 seconds
```

---

### 6. ✅ FIXED INFORMATION LEAKAGE
**File:** `/app/api/.well-known/jwks.json/route.ts`

**What was fixed:**
- Removed error details from response headers
- Generic error messages for clients
- Detailed logging only server-side
- No stack traces or internal paths exposed

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Generic error response without details
return new NextResponse(
  JSON.stringify({
    error: 'Internal server error',
    message: 'An error occurred while processing your request'
  }),
  { status: 500 }
);
```

---

## ADDITIONAL SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS

### 7. ✅ Service Degradation Handling
- JWKS endpoint returns 503 when keys unavailable
- Proper Retry-After headers
- No fallback to insecure keys

### 8. ✅ Request Validation
- Input validation on all parameters
- Request ID tracking for audit trails
- Client IP tracking for rate limiting

### 9. ✅ Monitoring & Metrics
- Track rate limit violations
- Monitor emergency mode usage
- Log security events for analysis

---

## SECURITY HEADERS CONFIGURATION

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
```
default-src 'self'
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{generated}'
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
img-src 'self' data: https: blob:
connect-src 'self' https://paintbox.fly.dev
frame-ancestors 'none'
```

### HSTS (Production Only)
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

---

## TESTING CHECKLIST

### Rate Limiting Tests
```bash
# Test JWKS rate limiting (should fail after 10 requests)
for i in {1..15}; do 
  curl -I https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json
  sleep 0.5
done

# Check for 429 response and Retry-After header
```

### CORS Tests
```bash
# Test from unauthorized origin (should fail)
curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com" \
     -I https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json

# Test from authorized origin (should succeed)
curl -H "Origin: https://paintbox.fly.dev" \
     -I https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json
```

### Security Headers Test
```bash
# Check all security headers
curl -I https://paintbox.fly.dev/.well-known/jwks.json | grep -E \
  "X-Frame-Options|X-Content-Type-Options|Strict-Transport-Security|Content-Security-Policy"
```
