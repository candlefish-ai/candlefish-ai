- [x] Updated environment example (`.env.example`)

### 4.4 Deployment Automation ✅
- [x] Created secure deployment script (`scripts/deploy-secure.sh`)
- [x] Integrated pre-deployment checks
- [x] Added post-deployment verification

### Files Created:
- `/Makefile` - Unified operations commands

## 📋 Next Steps for Production Deployment

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Setup AWS Secrets Manager**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup-secrets.sh
   ./scripts/setup-secrets.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Fly.io with AWS Credentials**
   ```bash
   fly secrets set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-key>
   fly secrets set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret>
   fly secrets set AWS_REGION=us-west-2
   ```

3. **Update Salesforce/Company Cam Secrets**
   ```bash
   # Update with actual credentials in AWS Secrets Manager Console
   # Or use: make secrets-update NAME=salesforce VALUE='{"client_id":"..."}'
   ```

4. **Deploy Secure Configuration**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/deploy-secure.sh
   ./scripts/deploy-secure.sh production
   ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   make health-check
   make fly-status
   make monitor
   ```
