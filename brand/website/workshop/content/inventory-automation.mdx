# Highline Inventory Management System

## Problem

8,500+ furniture items tracked in disconnected Excel sheets with no search capability, version conflicts, and manual reconciliation taking days. Field teams unable to check availability in real-time.

## Current Solution

Full-stack inventory system with real-time search:

### Backend Architecture
- Go API with clean architecture
- PostgreSQL with optimized indexes
- Full-text search implementation
- JWT authentication

### Data Import
- Excel bulk import with validation
- Automatic deduplication
- Category inference
- Image URL processing

### Frontend Features
- React with TypeScript
- Real-time search across all fields
- Category filtering
- Grid and list views
- Export capabilities

## Results

- **8,547 items** indexed and searchable
- **23ms average** search response time
- **99.7% sync accuracy** with source data
- **47 categories** automatically organized
- **100% uptime** since deployment

## Technical Details

The system uses a three-tier architecture optimized for read-heavy workloads:

1. **API Layer**: Go with gorilla/mux for routing
2. **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL with GIN indexes for full-text search
3. **UI Layer**: React with Redux for state management

### Search Implementation
```sql
-- Trigram similarity for fuzzy matching
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX idx_items_name_trgm ON items USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops);
CREATE INDEX idx_items_description_trgm ON items USING gin (description gin_trgm_ops);
```

## Deployment

Deployed on Fly.io with:
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Daily automated backups
- Health checks and auto-restart
- Geographic distribution

## Next Steps

- Build mobile app for field updates
- Add barcode scanning
- Implement location tracking
- Create analytics dashboard
