# Netlify Function Deployment Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Netlify Function Setup
- Created `/netlify/functions/consideration.js` to handle form submissions
- Configured proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Implemented rate limiting (2 requests per minute per IP)
- Added comprehensive form validation

### 2. Email Integration
- Integrated Resend email service for sending notifications
- Configured to send emails to `hello@candlefish.ai`
- Added graceful fallback when API key is not configured
- Email includes all form data: years in operation, operational challenge, manual hours, investment range, name, role, email, company

### 3. Form Updates
- Updated consideration form to call `/.netlify/functions/consideration` instead of `/api/consideration`
- Maintained existing form validation and user experience
- Form continues to show queue position and expected consideration date

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Added Resend dependency to `package.json`
- Configured `netlify.toml` for functions bundling
- Set placeholder environment variable for `RESEND_API_KEY`
- Created AWS secret for future Resend key storage

### 5. Deployment
- Successfully deployed to https://test.candlefish.ai
- Netlify site ID: 39b5e2aa-5a6f-42c8-a721-807b164c90d9
- Function is live and responding correctly
- Site builds and deploys automatically

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Function Endpoint Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://test.candlefish.ai/.netlify/functions/consideration
```
**Status**: ✅ Working  
**Response**: Returns success with queue position

### Form Page
**URL**: https://test.candlefish.ai/consideration/  
**Status**: ✅ Loading correctly

## 📧 Email Setup (Next Step)

To enable email notifications:

1. Create Resend account at https://resend.com
2. Verify domain `candlefish.ai`
3. Generate API key
4. Update environment variable:
   ```bash
   netlify env:set RESEND_API_KEY "re_your_key_here" --context production --secret
   ```

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

- `/netlify/functions/consideration.js` - New Netlify Function
- `package.json` - Added Resend dependency
- `netlify.toml` - Added functions configuration
- `app/consideration/page.tsx` - Updated API endpoint
- `deploy-test.sh` - Updated site ID and output directory

## 🔄 How It Works

1. User fills out consideration form at `/consideration`
2. Form submits to `/.netlify/functions/consideration`
3. Function validates all fields and applies rate limiting
4. If Resend is configured, sends email to `hello@candlefish.ai`
5. Returns success response with queue position
6. All requests are logged for tracking

## 🚀 Production Ready

The solution is production-ready and working correctly. The only remaining task is to configure the Resend API key for actual email delivery. Until then, all form submissions are being logged and validated successfully.

**Live Form**: https://test.candlefish.ai/consideration/
