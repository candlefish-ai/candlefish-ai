  from_agent: "Agent Name"
  to_agent: "Target Agent"
  timestamp: "ISO 8601"
  task_completed: 
    - "List of completed items"
  dependencies_ready:
    - "List of ready dependencies"
  blockers:
    - "Any blocking issues"
  next_steps:
    - "Recommended next actions"
  artifacts:
    - path: "File paths"
      description: "What the artifact contains"
  notes: "Additional context"
```

### 2. Dependency Management

```

### 3. Communication Channels

#### Async Communication (Via Files)
```
/deployment/
  /handoffs/
    YYYY-MM-DD-agent-handoff.md
  /status/
    current-status.md
    blockers.md
  /decisions/
    architecture-decisions.md
    tech-choices.md
```

#### Status Updates
Each agent updates their section in `/deployment/status/current-status.md`:

```markdown
## Infrastructure Agent Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10 14:00
**Current Task**: PostgreSQL deployment
**Progress**: 60%
**Blockers**: None
**Next Update**: 2025-08-10 18:00

## Backend Agent Status
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-10 14:30
**Current Task**: Waiting for database
**Progress**: 0%
**Blockers**: Database not ready
**Next Update**: When unblocked
```

### 4. Task Queue Management

```yaml
task_queue:
  high_priority:
    - id: "FIX-001"
      task: "Fix website deployment"
      agent: "Frontend"
      deadline: "2025-08-12"
      dependencies: []
      
  medium_priority:
    - id: "INFRA-001"
      task: "Deploy PostgreSQL"
      agent: "Infrastructure"
      deadline: "2025-08-13"
      dependencies: []

### 7. Performance Monitoring

```yaml
agent_metrics:
  task_completion_rate:
    target: 90%
    measurement: "Tasks completed on time / Total tasks"
    
  handoff_quality:
    target: 95%
    measurement: "Successful handoffs / Total handoffs"
    
  blocker_resolution_time:
    target: "< 4 hours"
    measurement: "Time from blocker raised to resolved"
    
  test_coverage:
    target: 80%
    measurement: "Lines covered / Total lines"
```

### 8. Emergency Procedures
