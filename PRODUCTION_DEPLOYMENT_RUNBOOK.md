```

## üîç Monitoring & Validation

### Health Check Commands

```bash
# Comprehensive health check (recommended)
./scripts/health-check-suite.sh production comprehensive

# Quick health check
./scripts/health-check-suite.sh production quick

# Check deployment status
./scripts/production-deployment-orchestrator.sh status
```

- [ ] **SEO elements present**: Meta tags, structured data

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Immediate rollback
./scripts/production-deployment-orchestrator.sh rollback

# Manual rollback if needed
git checkout HEAD~1
./scripts/production-deployment-orchestrator.sh deploy
```

### Incident Response Workflow

1. **Detection**: Monitor alerts in Slack #critical-alerts
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity (P0-P4)
3. **Response**: Follow appropriate procedures
4. **Communication**: Update stakeholders via Slack
5. **Resolution**: Fix and validate
6. **Post-mortem**: Document lessons learned

### Emergency Contacts

- **On-call Engineer**: Available 24/7 via PagerDuty
- **Platform Team**: Business hours support
- **Security Team**: Security-related incidents

## üìä Expected Deployment Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Pre-deployment Setup | 5-10 min | Database setup, environment verification |
| Code Preparation | 2-5 min | Git operations, commit, push |
| CI/CD Pipeline | 15-25 min | Automated testing and building |
| Site Deployment | 10-15 min | Netlify deployments for all three sites |
| DNS/SSL Configuration | 5-10 min | Certificate validation |
| Health Checks | 5-10 min | Comprehensive validation |
| **Total** | **42-65 min** | Complete zero-downtime deployment |

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Site Not Accessible
1. **Check DNS**: `nslookup domain.candlefish.ai`
2. **Verify SSL**: `openssl s_client -connect domain.candlefish.ai:443`
3. **Check Netlify Status**: Review deployment logs
4. **Verify DNS Records**: Ensure CNAME points to Netlify

#### Slow Response Times
1. **Check CDN**: Verify Netlify CDN distribution
2. **Optimize Assets**: Ensure proper caching headers
3. **Monitor Metrics**: Check Netlify analytics
4. **Scale Resources**: Consider plan upgrade if needed

#### SSL Certificate Issues  
1. **Force Renewal**: Trigger new certificate in Netlify
2. **Check CNAME**: Verify proper DNS configuration
3. **Wait for Propagation**: Allow 5-10 minutes for changes
4. **Contact Support**: If issues persist

### Log Locations

```bash
# Deployment logs
ls -la logs/production-deployment-*.log

# Health check reports
ls -la logs/health-check-*.json

# Database setup logs  
ls -la logs/database-setup-*.log
```
