# The Candlefish Alignment Manifesto

We believe the future of work will be built on trust between humans and intelligent systems—not imposed, but earned.

In the decades ahead, the winners will not be those who build the most powerful tools, but those who build tools that stay in tune with the people they serve as they evolve. At Candlefish.ai, we see alignment not as a compliance problem, but as a living relationship.

## 1. Alignment Is an Emergent Property

Rigid rules break when intelligence scales. Alignment must arise naturally from the way systems learn, adapt, and interact. Our platforms are designed to listen, interpret, and adapt—so they grow more useful, not more brittle, as capabilities increase.

## 2. Feedback Is the Real Control Layer

Instead of hard-coded directives, we rely on continuous feedback loops—between users, operators, and the AI itself. These loops ensure that when priorities shift, the system shifts with them, without losing the thread of shared purpose.

## 3. Scale Starts Small

We prove alignment in contained environments before expanding it. Every feature, every agent, every workflow starts in a focused, high-signal setting. Only after alignment holds under stress do we scale to broader contexts.

## 4. Autonomy Demands Responsibility

As our systems grow more autonomous, our responsibility deepens. We embed alignment metrics and safeguards from day one—so autonomy never drifts into misalignment. This is not an afterthought; it is our design philosophy.

## 5. Alignment Is a Competitive Advantage

In the AI era, misaligned tools erode trust and stall adoption. Aligned tools accelerate compounding value—because when systems stay in sync with their operators, they amplify human potential rather than replace or resist it.

## Our Commitment

Every Candlefish.ai product must get smarter and stay truer to its operators over time. If we cannot align a system organically and sustainably, we will not ship it.

The future belongs to those who can scale intelligence without losing coherence. Alignment isn't our feature—it's our foundation.
