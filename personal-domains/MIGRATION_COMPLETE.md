## Completed Actions

✅ Created backup of all migrated content at:
   `/Users/patricksmith/migration-backups/[timestamp]`

   - Pushed to private GitHub repo

✅ Created acupcake-vault repository at:
   `/Users/patricksmith/acupcake-vault`
   - Set up vault structure
   - Added security headers
   - Created landing page
   - Pushed to private GitHub repo

✅ Cleaned candlefish-ai repository:
   - Removed apps/5470-inventory
   - Removed migrate-to-family-vault.sh
   - Updated .gitignore to prevent re-addition
   - Committed changes

## Next Steps

### Deploy inventory.highline.work
```bash
cd /Users/patricksmith/family-projects
netlify init
netlify domains:add inventory.highline.work
cd apps/5470-inventory
npm install
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=.next
```

### Deploy acupcake.shop
```bash
cd /Users/patricksmith/acupcake-vault
netlify init
netlify domains:add acupcake.shop
netlify deploy --prod --dir=public
# Enable Netlify Identity for vault access
```

### Configure DNS (if needed)
Both highline.work and acupcake.shop should already have:
- Nameservers: ns1-4.squarespace.com
- Add CNAME records pointing to Netlify sites once created

## Security Reminders

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: 
- Keep family-projects and acupcake-vault repositories PRIVATE
- Never add external collaborators to family/personal repos
- Use Netlify Identity for authentication on deployed sites
- Regular security audits recommended
- Enable 2FA on all accounts

## Repository Structure

### family-projects
```
/apps/5470-inventory  - Inventory management app
/deploy-inventory.sh  - Deployment script
```

### acupcake-vault
```
/vault/              - Secure document storage
/public/             - Public website content
/netlify.toml        - Security configuration
```

## Migration Script Location
The complete migration script is saved at:
`/Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/personal-domains/highline-work/scripts/complete-family-migration.sh`

This can be used as reference or re-run if needed (though repositories now exist).

Migration completed successfully. All three domains are now properly separated with appropriate access controls.
