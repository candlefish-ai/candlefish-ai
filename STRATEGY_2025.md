### Key Technical Decisions

- **Database**: Hybrid approach (shared core, separate verticals)
- **API**: GraphQL federation with schema evolution
- **Events**: AWS EventBridge for serverless scaling
- **Frontend**: Modular monolith with Next.js
- **Deployment**: Monorepo with Kubernetes orchestration

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Distribution Model

1. **Operator Network** (Primary)
   - 50-100 certified partners by Year 2
   - Territory exclusivity for top performers
   - Equity participation for key operators

2. **Channel Partnerships** (Secondary)
   - Equipment suppliers (paint, brewing, engraving)
   - Industry associations
   - Complementary software vendors

3. **Excel Migration** (Positioning)
   - "Bring your Excel, leave with an app"
   - 5-minute transformation demos
   - Before/after case studies

### Customer Acquisition

- **Year 1 Focus**: 3 lighthouse customers per vertical
- **Reference Selling**: Published case studies with ROI metrics
- **Land & Expand**: Start with core workflow, expand to full suite

## Risk Management

### Critical Risks & Mitigations
